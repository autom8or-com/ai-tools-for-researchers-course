## Course Policies

### Attendance
Regular attendance is expected. Missing more than three sessions may result in an incomplete grade.

### Late Assignments
Assignments submitted late will incur a 10% penalty per day. Extensions may be granted with prior approval.

### Academic Integrity
While this course teaches AI assistance for research, all AI contributions must be properly attributed. Presenting AI-generated work as entirely your own constitutes academic dishonesty.

### Technology Requirements
Participants must bring a laptop to each session and have reliable internet access. Technical support will be available during class sessions.
