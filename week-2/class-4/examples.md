## Elicit Examples

### 1. Basic Research Question

#### Prompt in Elicit:
```
What are the effects of mindfulness meditation on stress reduction in college students?
```

#### Sample Response:
Elicit will return a results page with relevant papers, including:

**Paper 1: "Effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on College Students' Psychological Well-being"**
- **Authors**: Johnson et al. (2022)
- **Publication**: Journal of American College Health
- **Study design**: Randomized controlled trial
- **Sample size**: 87 undergraduate students
- **Summary**: 8-week MBSR intervention significantly reduced perceived stress scores compared to control (p<0.01)

**Paper 2: "Mindfulness Meditation and Cortisol Regulation in University Students: A Longitudinal Study"**
- **Authors**: Chen & Williams (2021)
- **Publication**: Psychoneuroendocrinology
- **Study design**: Longitudinal pre-post design with control
- **Sample size**: 64 students
- **Summary**: Decreased cortisol levels observed in meditation group after 6-week intervention

**Paper 3: "A Meta-Analysis of Mindfulness Interventions for Stress Management in College Populations"**
- **Authors**: Singh et al. (2023)
- **Publication**: Mindfulness
- **Study design**: Meta-analysis
- **Sample size**: 28 studies (N=2,472 participants)
- **Summary**: Moderate effect sizes for stress reduction (g=0.59) and anxiety (g=0.52)

*Elicit also provides AI-generated summaries for key aspects of each paper:*

**Research question**: Most studies investigated whether mindfulness interventions reduce perceived stress and related outcomes in college/university students.

**Methodology**: Predominantly randomized controlled trials with pre-post measurements using instruments like the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Intervention duration ranged from 3-12 weeks with most studies using an 8-week protocol.

**Key findings**: Consistent evidence for reduced perceived stress (76% of studies), improved anxiety symptoms (68%), and enhanced self-regulation (59%). Effects appear to be dose-dependent, with longer practice associated with stronger outcomes.

**Limitations**: Small sample sizes in many studies, reliance on self-report measures, limited long-term follow-up, and potential selection bias from volunteer participants.

### 2. Research Gap Identification

#### Prompt in Elicit:
```
What are the understudied aspects of the relationship between sleep quality and academic performance?
```

#### Sample Response:
Elicit will analyze multiple papers and identify potential research gaps:

**Identified Research Gaps:**

1. **Mediating Biological Mechanisms**
   - Limited research on the neurobiological pathways linking sleep and academic performance
   - Few studies measuring biomarkers (cortisol, inflammatory markers) alongside sleep metrics
   - Gap in understanding how sleep affects specific cognitive processes relevant to different academic tasks

2. **Diverse Student Populations**
   - Underrepresentation of community college students in the literature
   - Limited research on first-generation college students and sleep challenges
   - Few studies addressing cultural differences in sleep patterns and academic effects
   - Gap in research on students with pre-existing sleep disorders or conditions

3. **Methodological Limitations**
   - Overreliance on self-reported sleep measures rather than objective measures (polysomnography, actigraphy)
   - Lack of longitudinal studies tracking sleep patterns throughout academic careers
   - Limited ecological validity in laboratory sleep studies
   - Few interventional studies testing targeted sleep improvement strategies

4. **Contextual Factors**
   - Insufficient attention to how institutional policies affect student sleep
   - Limited research on the interaction between sleep, academic performance, and digital technology use
   - Understudied impact of housing conditions and roommate dynamics on sleep quality
   - Gap in understanding how academic pressure and deadline clustering impact sleep patterns

5. **Performance Metrics**
   - Narrow focus on GPA as the primary outcome measure
   - Limited research on sleep effects on specific skill acquisition
   - Few studies examining sleep impact on creativity and problem-solving
   - Gap in understanding effects on non-cognitive skills relevant to academic success

**Emerging Research Opportunities:**
- Sleep intervention studies tailored to specific academic disciplines
- Technology-enabled sleep monitoring in natural academic environments
- Integrating chronobiology (circadian preference) into course scheduling research
- Examining how sleep quality affects specific learning processes rather than just outcomes

### 3. Comparative Analysis of Methods

#### Prompt in Elicit:
```
Compare quantitative and qualitative methods for researching the impact of social media on adolescent mental health.
```

#### Sample Response:
Elicit will generate a structured comparison based on analysis of multiple papers:

**Methodological Comparison: Researching Social Media and Adolescent Mental Health**

**Quantitative Approaches:**

*Common Methods:*
- **Cross-sectional surveys**: Large-scale assessment of correlations between social media use patterns and mental health indicators
- **Longitudinal cohort studies**: Tracking social media use and mental health outcomes over time
- **Experience sampling**: Repeated brief assessments of social media use and mood in real-time
- **Experimental designs**: Manipulating social media exposure in controlled settings

*Strengths:*
- Establishes statistical relationships between variables
- Allows for larger, more representative samples
- Enables precise measurement of usage patterns (time, frequency)
- Facilitates comparison across demographic groups
- Produces generalizable findings
- Can control for confounding variables

*Limitations:*
- Often relies on self-reported usage data
- May oversimplify complex social media experiences
- Difficulty establishing causality
- May miss contextual nuances of social media interactions
- Cannot fully capture subjective experiences
- Often focuses on quantity rather than quality of use

**Qualitative Approaches:**

*Common Methods:*
- **In-depth interviews**: Exploring adolescents' lived experiences with social media
- **Focus groups**: Examining shared and divergent perspectives
- **Digital ethnography**: Observing actual online behaviors and interactions
- **Content analysis**: Examining the nature of social media posts and interactions
- **Diary studies**: Recording day-to-day experiences with social media

*Strengths:*
- Provides rich, contextual understanding of experiences
- Captures nuanced aspects of social media interactions
- Allows adolescents to describe experiences in their own words
- Identifies emerging phenomena not captured in standardized measures
- Explores mechanisms and processes behind statistical relationships
- Better represents the quality and meaning of social media use

*Limitations:*
- Smaller sample sizes limit generalizability
- Subject to researcher interpretation biases
- Time-intensive data collection and analysis
- Challenges in systematic comparison across cases
- May be influenced by social desirability in reporting
- Limited ability to establish prevalence or statistical significance

**Mixed Methods Approaches:**

*Promising Integrations:*
- Sequential designs: Using qualitative insights to inform quantitative measurement
- Parallel designs: Collecting both types of data simultaneously to provide complementary insights
- Case-selection approaches: Using quantitative data to identify interesting cases for in-depth qualitative study
- Explanatory designs: Using qualitative methods to explain mechanisms behind quantitative findings

*Recent Innovations:*
- Digital trace data combined with qualitative interviews
- Computational analysis of qualitative social media content at scale
- Physiological measures combined with qualitative accounts of experiences
- Participatory approaches involving adolescents in research design

**Research Questions Best Suited to Each Approach:**

*Quantitative Methods:*
- Prevalence of specific social media behaviors
- Strength of association between usage patterns and mental health outcomes
- Demographic differences in social media effects
- Effectiveness of interventions at scale
- Predictive models of risk based on usage patterns

*Qualitative Methods:*
- How adolescents make meaning of their social media experiences
- The nature of harmful or beneficial interactions
- Adolescents' coping strategies for negative experiences
- Cultural and contextual factors shaping social media use
- Emerging trends in platform use and online behaviors
