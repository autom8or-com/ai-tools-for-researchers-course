## Task 1: Comparative Literature Search (30%)

### Instructions:
1. Select a specific research question or topic directly relevant to your work
2. Conduct parallel literature searches using:
   - Elicit
   - Semantic Scholar
   - One traditional research database (e.g., PubMed, JSTOR, Google Scholar, Web of Science)
3. Use the same core search terms/question across all platforms, adapted appropriately for each
4. Document your search process and results

### Deliverable:
Submit a comparative analysis (600-800 words) with screenshots that includes:
- Your research question and why it's relevant to your work
- Search strategies used for each platform (include exact search terms/queries)
- Quantitative comparison of results (number of relevant papers, date ranges, etc.)
- Qualitative comparison of results (types of papers, relevance, unique findings)
- Venn diagram or table showing overlap and unique papers across platforms
- Critical evaluation of each platform's strengths and limitations for your specific search
- Discussion of which papers you might have missed using only one approach

## Task 2: Advanced Feature Utilization (30%)

### Instructions:
Choose TWO of the following advanced analyses to perform:

**Option A: Citation Network Analysis**
- Select an important paper in your field
- Use Semantic Scholar to map its citation network
- Analyze both papers it cites and papers citing it
- Identify key intellectual lineages and influences
- Use Elicit to enhance understanding of key papers in the network

**Option B: Research Gap Identification**
- Use both tools to systematically identify research gaps in your area
- In Elicit, use explicit gap-focused queries
- In Semantic Scholar, analyze patterns in literature coverage
- Cross-validate findings between platforms
- Evaluate the significance of identified gaps

**Option C: Methodological Comparative Analysis**
- Use both tools to analyze methodological approaches in your field
- Identify trends, debates, and innovations in methodology
- Create a comparative framework of different approaches
- Assess strengths and limitations of each method
- Identify methodological gaps or opportunities

**Option D: Cross-Disciplinary Connection Mapping**
- Explore how your research topic connects to other disciplines
- Use both tools to identify cross-disciplinary applications
- Map concepts and approaches borrowed across fields
- Identify potential novel interdisciplinary connections
- Assess barriers and opportunities for integration

### Deliverable:
For each of your two chosen analyses:
- Screenshots documenting your process and key findings
- Visual representation of your analysis (network map, concept map, comparison table, etc.)
- 400-500 word analytical summary of your findings
- Critical reflection on the tools' effectiveness for this type of analysis
- Discussion of how these findings inform your research direction

## Task 3: Research Workflow Integration (20%)

### Instructions:
1. Design a personal research workflow that effectively integrates Elicit and Semantic Scholar
2. Consider how these tools complement traditional research approaches
3. Develop a systematic process for literature discovery, verification, and management
4. Address potential limitations and verification requirements

### Deliverable:
Submit:
- A visual workflow diagram showing your integrated research process
- A 400-500 word explanation of your workflow, including:
  - When and how you would use each tool
  - Decision points for moving between tools
  - Verification processes to ensure accuracy and comprehensiveness
  - Integration with other research tools (reference managers, NotebookLM, etc.)
  - Documentation practices for maintaining research transparency
- A brief discussion of potential challenges in this workflow and how you'll address them

---

## Task 4: Case Study Application (20%)

### Instructions:
Apply your new skills with these tools to a specific case study relevant to your research:

1. Select ONE of the following scenarios (or propose an alternative to your instructor):
   - Planning a literature review for a new project
   - Developing a theoretical framework for your research
   - Identifying methodological approaches for a specific research question
   - Exploring an emerging subtopic within your field
   - Preparing a grant proposal literature background

2. Document how you used Elicit and Semantic Scholar to address this specific need
3. Analyze the effectiveness of these tools compared to your previous approach

### Deliverable:
Submit a case study report (500-600 words) that includes:
- Description of your selected scenario and its importance to your work
- Step-by-step account of how you used both tools for this specific purpose
- Key findings or insights generated through this process
- Assessment of time savings or quality improvements compared to traditional methods
- Specific examples of value added by these AI research tools
- Critical reflection on limitations encountered and how you addressed them
- Screenshots documenting your process and results

---

## Task 5: Reflection and Skill Development (10%)

### Instructions:
Reflect on your learning experience with these tools and identify areas for further skill development.

### Deliverable:
Write a reflection (300-400 words) addressing:
- Most valuable skills gained from working with these tools
- Most surprising discoveries about the tools' capabilities or limitations
- Specific ways these tools will change your research practices
- Skills you need to develop further for maximizing these tools
- Ethical considerations when using AI-powered research tools
- How you will evaluate and verify AI-assisted research in the future
