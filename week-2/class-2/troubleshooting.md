# Elicit and Semantic Scholar Troubleshooting Guide
## Week 2, Class 4

This guide addresses common challenges researchers face when using Elicit and Semantic Scholar and provides practical solutions for each.

## Elicit Troubleshooting

### Problem: Irrelevant or Off-Topic Results

**Possible Causes:**
- Ambiguous research question
- Terminology differences across fields
- Too many concepts in one query
- Platform knowledge limitations

**Solutions:**
1. **Refine question specificity**: Include more context and precise terminology
2. **Add field identifiers**: Specify your discipline (e.g., "in cognitive psychology")
3. **Break complex questions**: Split multi-part questions into separate queries
4. **Use field-specific terminology**: Use the exact terms common in your field
5. **Try alternative phrasings**: Reformulate the question using different terms

**Example Improvement:**
- **Poor query:** "How does attention affect memory?"
- **Better query:** "How does selective attention influence working memory capacity in healthy adults?"

### Problem: Missing Key Papers You Know Exist

**Possible Causes:**
- Papers not in Elicit's database
- Terminology mismatches
- Recency of publication
- Access limitations

**Solutions:**
1. **Search by title fragments**: Include exact phrases from the paper title
2. **Search by author name**: Add "by [author surname]" to your query
3. **Include publication year**: Add a date reference if known
4. **Cross-check with other tools**: Verify coverage with Semantic Scholar or Google Scholar
5. **Report missing papers**: Use feedback mechanisms to improve the database

**Example Improvement:**
- **Poor query:** "Effects of meditation on anxiety"
- **Better query:** "Effects of mindfulness meditation on generalized anxiety disorder by Davidson published around 2018"

### Problem: Poor or Inaccurate Summaries

**Possible Causes:**
- Limited access to full text
- Complex or technical paper content
- Unusual paper structure
- Field-specific terminology confusion

**Solutions:**
1. **Always verify against originals**: Check summaries against abstracts or full papers
2. **Use for triage only**: Rely on summaries for initial screening, not deep analysis
3. **Request targeted information**: Ask for specific aspects rather than general summaries
4. **Provide context**: Add field-specific details to your queries
5. **Report inaccuracies**: Use feedback mechanisms to improve summary quality

**Example Improvement:**
When encountering inaccurate summaries:
- Access the original paper through provided links
- Make a note of summary limitations for that paper type
- Consider creating your own summaries for complex papers

### Problem: Limited Extraction Capabilities

**Possible Causes:**
- Information not clearly stated in original text
- Complex data presentation
- Statistical or mathematical content
- Field-specific reporting formats

**Solutions:**
1. **Specify extraction targets**: Ask for specific pieces of information
2. **Verify extracted data**: Always check against the original paper
3. **Try multiple formulations**: Ask the same question in different ways
4. **Combine with manual review**: Use extractions as starting points, then verify
5. **Focus on well-structured elements**: Methods, sample sizes, and results are often more reliably extracted

**Example Improvement:**
- **Broad request:** "Extract the results from this paper."
- **Targeted request:** "What was the sample size, main statistical test used, and p-value for the primary outcome?"

### Problem: Technical Difficulties or Platform Errors

**Possible Causes:**
- Server issues
- Browser compatibility
- High usage volume
- Feature updates or changes

**Solutions:**
1. **Refresh the page**: Simple refreshing solves many temporary issues
2. **Try a different browser**: Chrome often works best with newer web applications
3. **Clear cache/cookies**: Resolve potential storage issues
4. **Wait and retry**: Service may be experiencing high demand
5. **Contact support**: Report persistent issues through official channels
