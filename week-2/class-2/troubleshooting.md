# Elicit and Semantic Scholar Troubleshooting Guide
## Week 2, Class 4

This guide addresses common challenges researchers face when using Elicit and Semantic Scholar and provides practical solutions for each.

## Elicit Troubleshooting

### Problem: Irrelevant or Off-Topic Results

**Possible Causes:**
- Ambiguous research question
- Terminology differences across fields
- Too many concepts in one query
- Platform knowledge limitations

**Solutions:**
1. **Refine question specificity**: Include more context and precise terminology
2. **Add field identifiers**: Specify your discipline (e.g., "in cognitive psychology")
3. **Break complex questions**: Split multi-part questions into separate queries
4. **Use field-specific terminology**: Use the exact terms common in your field
5. **Try alternative phrasings**: Reformulate the question using different terms

**Example Improvement:**
- **Poor query:** "How does attention affect memory?"
- **Better query:** "How does selective attention influence working memory capacity in healthy adults?"

### Problem: Missing Key Papers You Know Exist

**Possible Causes:**
- Papers not in Elicit's database
- Terminology mismatches
- Recency of publication
- Access limitations

**Solutions:**
1. **Search by title fragments**: Include exact phrases from the paper title
2. **Search by author name**: Add "by [author surname]" to your query
3. **Include publication year**: Add a date reference if known
4. **Cross-check with other tools**: Verify coverage with Semantic Scholar or Google Scholar
5. **Report missing papers**: Use feedback mechanisms to improve the database

**Example Improvement:**
- **Poor query:** "Effects of meditation on anxiety"
- **Better query:** "Effects of mindfulness meditation on generalized anxiety disorder by Davidson published around 2018"

### Problem: Poor or Inaccurate Summaries

**Possible Causes:**
- Limited access to full text
- Complex or technical paper content
- Unusual paper structure
- Field-specific terminology confusion

**Solutions:**
1. **Always verify against originals**: Check summaries against abstracts or full papers
2. **Use for triage only**: Rely on summaries for initial screening, not deep analysis
3. **Request targeted information**: Ask for specific aspects rather than general summaries
4. **Provide context**: Add field-specific details to your queries
5. **Report inaccuracies**: Use feedback mechanisms to improve summary quality

**Example Improvement:**
When encountering inaccurate summaries:
- Access the original paper through provided links
- Make a note of summary limitations for that paper type
- Consider creating your own summaries for complex papers

### Problem: Limited Extraction Capabilities

**Possible Causes:**
- Information not clearly stated in original text
- Complex data presentation
- Statistical or mathematical content
- Field-specific reporting formats

**Solutions:**
1. **Specify extraction targets**: Ask for specific pieces of information
2. **Verify extracted data**: Always check against the original paper
3. **Try multiple formulations**: Ask the same question in different ways
4. **Combine with manual review**: Use extractions as starting points, then verify
5. **Focus on well-structured elements**: Methods, sample sizes, and results are often more reliably extracted

**Example Improvement:**
- **Broad request:** "Extract the results from this paper."
- **Targeted request:** "What was the sample size, main statistical test used, and p-value for the primary outcome?"

### Problem: Technical Difficulties or Platform Errors

**Possible Causes:**
- Server issues
- Browser compatibility
- High usage volume
- Feature updates or changes

**Solutions:**
1. **Refresh the page**: Simple refreshing solves many temporary issues
2. **Try a different browser**: Chrome often works best with newer web applications
3. **Clear cache/cookies**: Resolve potential storage issues
4. **Wait and retry**: Service may be experiencing high demand
5. **Contact support**: Report persistent issues through official channels

## Semantic Scholar Troubleshooting

### Problem: Overwhelming Number of Results

**Possible Causes:**
- Too broad search terms
- Common terminology across fields
- High-volume research area
- Inadequate filtering

**Solutions:**
1. **Use advanced search operators**: Combine terms with AND, OR, NOT
2. **Add field-specific limiters**: Include your discipline as a search term
3. **Apply multiple filters**: Use year, publication type, and other filters
4. **Use exact phrases**: Put specific terms in quotes
5. **Add methodological terms**: Include study design or method types

**Example Improvement:**
- **Broad search:** "cancer treatment"
- **Refined search:** "immunotherapy" AND "pancreatic cancer" AND year:2018-2023 NOT "review"

### Problem: Can't Find Specific Papers

**Possible Causes:**
- Indexing delays for new publications
- Title variants or special characters
- Author name variants
- Publication not indexed

**Solutions:**
1. **Search by DOI**: Use the Digital Object Identifier when available
2. **Try partial title search**: Use distinctive words from the title in quotes
3. **Search by author and year**: Combine author surname with publication year
4. **Check alternate spellings**: Author names may have variants
5. **Search by title and first author**: Most reliable for specific paper finding

**Example Improvement:**
- **Difficult to find:** "The impact of CRISPR-Cas9 on genetic research"
- **Better approach:** author:"Zhang F" AND year:2019 AND "CRISPR"

### Problem: Inconsistent or Inaccurate Citation Counts

**Possible Causes:**
- Different counting methodologies than other platforms
- Indexing delays
- Preprints and published versions counted separately
- Self-citations inclusion/exclusion

**Solutions:**
1. **Compare across platforms**: Check Google Scholar and Web of Science
2. **Look at citation trends**: Focus on patterns rather than absolute numbers
3. **Check for multiple versions**: Papers may have preprint and published versions
4. **Consider field norms**: Citation rates vary dramatically across disciplines
5. **Look beyond simple counts**: Examine "Highly Influential Citations" for impact

**Example Improvement:**
- Check for multiple entries of the same paper and combine mentally
- Focus on citation velocity rather than raw numbers for newer papers

### Problem: Limited Full Text Access

**Possible Causes:**
- Paywalled content
- Institutional access issues
- Repository limitations
- Publisher restrictions

**Solutions:**
1. **Check all available versions**: Click "All X versions" to see alternatives
2. **Look for open access options**: Filter for open access content
3. **Use institutional access**: Connect through your institution's subscriptions
4. **Try browser extensions**: Tools like Unpaywall can find legal open versions
5. **Consider interlibrary loan**: Request through your library for important papers

**Example Improvement:**
- Click on multiple source options provided
- Check if author has shared a version on personal or institutional sites
- Use your institution's proxy service when available

### Problem: Author Name Ambiguity

**Possible Causes:**
- Common names
- Name changes
- Inconsistent name formats
- Multiple researchers with same name

**Solutions:**
1. **Add institutional affiliation**: Include university or organization
2. **Add research field**: Narrow to specific discipline
3. **Look for ORCID identifiers**: Use unique researcher IDs when available
4. **Add distinctive co-authors**: Search for known collaborators
5. **Include specific paper titles**: Add known works by the author

**Example Improvement:**
- **Ambiguous search:** author:"J. Smith"
- **Better search:** author:"J. Smith" AND "University of Michigan" AND "cognitive psychology"

### Problem: Incomplete Author Profiles

**Possible Causes:**
- Name variants across publications
- Recent name changes
- Papers not correctly attributed
- Multiple profiles for same author

**Solutions:**
1. **Search for name variants**: Check for different formats or spellings
2. **Check institutional profiles**: Many researchers list complete publications there
3. **Look for Google Scholar or ORCID profiles**: May be more complete
4. **Report missing publications**: Some platforms allow profile corrections
5. **Check for merged profiles**: Platforms occasionally combine or split profiles

## Integration and Workflow Issues

### Problem: Difficulty Combining Results Across Platforms

**Possible Causes:**
- Different citation formats
- Inconsistent metadata
- Platform export limitations
- Reference manager compatibility

**Solutions:**
1. **Use consistent citation identifiers**: DOIs provide the most reliable linking
2. **Export in standard formats**: BibTeX or RIS work with most reference managers
3. **Create manual crosswalks**: Document how papers appear across platforms
4. **Use a reference manager**: Zotero, Mendeley, etc. can help deduplicate
5. **Develop consistent naming conventions**: For saved searches and collections

**Example Workflow:**
- Export citations from both platforms in the same format
- Import to reference manager and use deduplication features
- Tag papers with source platform for tracking

### Problem: Information Overload

**Possible Causes:**
- Too many papers to process
- Inadequate organization
- Lack of prioritization
- Feature complexity

**Solutions:**
1. **Set clear search boundaries**: Limit by date, methodology, or specific focus
2. **Create a triage system**: Quickly categorize papers as essential/useful/peripheral
3. **Use progressive summarization**: Start broad, then deep-dive on key papers
4. **Batch similar papers**: Group by methodology, theoretical approach, etc.
5. **Document decision criteria**: What makes a paper relevant for your purposes?

**Example Organization:**
- Create collections for different sub-topics
- Tag papers with methodological approaches
- Use a priority rating system (1-3 stars)
- Set time limits for exploration before synthesis

### Problem: Contradictory Information Across Platforms

**Possible Causes:**
- Different indexing methodologies
- Database coverage variations
- Update frequency differences
- Metadata inconsistencies

**Solutions:**
1. **Triangulate important information**: Verify across multiple sources
2. **Prioritize recency**: More recently updated platforms may have newer information
3. **Check primary sources**: Always verify against the original publication
4. **Document discrepancies**: Note differences for methodology transparency
5. **Consider platform strengths**: Each has areas of better coverage

**Example Approach:**
- Use Semantic Scholar for citation metrics
- Use Elicit for content summary
- Always check the original paper for critical information
- Document which source provided which information

## When to Try Alternative Tools

Consider supplementing or switching tools when:

1. **Field-specific needs**: Use specialized databases for niche research areas
2. **Historical research**: Seek tools with better coverage of older literature
3. **Very recent publications**: Try publisher sites or preprint servers
4. **Comprehensive systematic reviews**: Use multiple platforms for complete coverage
5. **Specialized content types**: Consider tools focusing on books, theses, or gray literature
6. **Visualization needs**: Explore dedicated bibliometric tools
7. **Programming experience**: Consider API access for custom analysis

Remember that no single tool provides perfect coverage or features. A multi-tool strategy, carefully documented, will yield the most comprehensive and reliable research results.
