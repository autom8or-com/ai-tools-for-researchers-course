2. Elicit automatically extracts and summarizes key information:
   - Research question
   - Methods
   - Sample size and characteristics
   - Main findings
   - Limitations
3. Note that summary quality varies based on paper accessibility and structure

### Verifying Summaries
1. Always compare summaries with the original abstract
2. Look for discrepancies or oversimplifications
3. For critical papers, access the full text through the provided link
4. Report inaccuracies to improve the system

## 4. Comparing Multiple Papers

### Selecting Papers for Comparison
1. Check the boxes next to papers you want to compare
2. Select 2-5 papers for most effective comparison
3. Focus on papers with similar topics but different approaches

### Using Comparison Tools
1. With multiple papers selected, look for the comparison option
2. Elicit will generate a comparison table showing:
   - Methods used
   - Sample sizes
   - Key findings
   - Study durations
   - Other extracted metadata
3. Scroll horizontally to view all comparison columns

### Analyzing Contradictions and Agreements
1. Look for patterns in findings across studies
2. Note methodological differences that might explain contradictory results
3. Consider sample sizes and study quality when evaluating conflicting evidence
4. Use the comparison to identify stronger evidence vs. preliminary findings

## 5. Data Extraction Features

### Setting Up Extraction Questions
1. With papers selected, look for the "Extract" feature
2. Elicit allows you to extract specific information across papers
3. Create custom extraction questions:
   - "What was the sample size?"
   - "What statistical methods were used?"
   - "What were the effect sizes?"

### Interpreting Extraction Results
1. Review the extraction table showing answers across papers
2. Look for missing data (when Elicit couldn't find the information)
3. Verify critical extractions against the source text
4. Use extraction for systematic collection of specific data points

### Custom Extractions
1. For specialized needs, create custom extraction templates
2. Define specific questions relevant to your research
3. Save extraction templates for future use
4. Export extraction results for analysis

## 6. Literature Organization

### Saving Papers and Searches
1. Select papers of interest by checking the boxes
2. Click "Save" to add them to your library
3. To save an entire search, look for the "Save Search" option
4. Add labels or notes to organize saved items

### Creating Literature Collections
1. Navigate to the "Research" tab to see saved items
2. Create custom collections based on subtopics or projects
3. Organize papers by:
   - Research question
   - Methodology
   - Chronology
   - Evidence strength

### Managing Your Research Library
1. Review saved papers periodically
2. Update collections as your research evolves
3. Export citations for reference management
4. Create research notes based on saved literature

## 7. Advanced Features

### Research Question Generation
1. Look for the "Brainstorm" or "Generate Questions" feature
2. Enter a broad topic of interest
3. Elicit will suggest specific research questions
4. Use these questions to stimulate new search directions

### Evidence Mapping
1. For certain topics, Elicit can create evidence maps
2. These visualize the strength and amount of evidence for specific claims
3. Look for patterns in research concentration
4. Identify areas with limited or contradictory evidence

### Literature Gap Identification
1. Use the comparison features to identify patterns in the literature
2. Look for:
   - Understudied populations
   - Methodological limitations
   - Unexplored variables
   - Theoretical inconsistencies
3. Formulate new research questions based on identified gaps

## 8. Exporting and Integration

### Citation Export
1. Select papers you wish to export
2. Look for export options (typically at the bottom of the selection panel)
3. Choose your preferred citation format:
   - BibTeX
   - RIS
   - APA
   - Other available formats
4. Download the citation file

### Integration with Reference Managers
1. Export citations in a format compatible with your reference manager
2. Import the file into:
   - Zotero
   - Mendeley
   - EndNote
   - Other reference management tools
3. Maintain links between Elicit and your reference manager

### Sharing Research
1. Look for sharing options within Elicit
2. Generate shareable links to your searches or collections
3. Consider what information is appropriate to share
4. Document your search methodology when sharing results

## 9. Best Practices for Effective Use

### Formulating Effective Questions
- Be specific about your research interest
- Include methodological terms when relevant
- Specify populations of interest
- Use field-specific terminology
- Break complex questions into simpler components

### Verification Workflow
1. Use Elicit for initial discovery and summaries
2. Verify key findings against original abstracts
3. Access full text for critical papers
4. Cross-check against other databases
5. Document limitations in AI-generated summaries

### Combining with Other Tools
- Use Elicit for broad literature discovery
- Export findings to NotebookLM for deeper analysis
- Complement with Semantic Scholar for citation analysis
- Integrate with traditional literature review methods
- Document your multi-tool workflow

## 10. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Limited or Irrelevant Results
- Try alternative phrasings of your question
- Use more specific terminology
- Break complex questions into parts
- Check for field-specific jargon
- Ensure you're not using overly niche terms

### Missing Key Papers
- Try multiple search approaches
- Use author names for known researchers
- Check citation lists of found papers
- Complement with traditional database searches
- Consider field-specific databases

### Inaccurate Summaries
- Report inaccuracies using feedback mechanisms
- Always verify against original text
- For critical information, rely on full text reading
- Consider paper complexity and structure
- Use summaries as starting points, not final evidence
