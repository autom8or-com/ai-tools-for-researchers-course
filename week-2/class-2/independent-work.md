## Research Application (Choose 2-3 Tasks)

### Task 1: Literature Discovery for a Current Project
Use both tools to find relevant literature for a current research project or interest.

**Steps:**
1. Identify a specific research question or topic you're currently working on
2. In Elicit:
   - Formulate your topic as a specific question
   - Review the top 10-15 results
   - Save the most relevant papers
   - Use the summary features to quickly assess relevance
3. In Semantic Scholar:
   - Search using key terms and advanced operators
   - Apply filters to focus on relevant papers
   - Sort by citation count, recency, or relevance as appropriate
   - Save the most relevant papers
4. Compare the results from both platforms:
   - Which papers appeared in both searches?
   - Which unique papers did each platform find?
   - What valuable papers might you have missed using only one platform?

**Reflection Questions:**
- Which platform provided more relevant results for your specific needs?
- What types of papers (methodological approaches, publication venues) were better represented on each platform?
- How might you refine your search strategy based on this experience?

### Task 2: Research Gap Identification
Use both tools to identify potential research gaps or opportunities in your field.

**Steps:**
1. In Elicit:
   - Ask explicitly about research gaps: "What are the understudied aspects of [your topic]?"
   - Look for papers that mention limitations or future research
   - Ask for methodological gaps: "What methodological approaches are underutilized in research on [your topic]?"
   - Note common limitations mentioned across papers
2. In Semantic Scholar:
   - Find highly cited papers in your area
   - Examine their "Future Work" or "Limitations" sections
   - Look for citation patterns: areas with few connections
   - Compare older vs. newer research to identify shifting focus
3. Synthesize findings from both platforms:
   - List potential research gaps identified
   - Note supporting evidence for each gap
   - Evaluate the significance of each gap
   - Consider methodological opportunities

**Reflection Questions:**
- Which approach was more effective for identifying meaningful gaps?
- How do the identified gaps align with your research interests?
- What types of gaps seem most promising for future research?
- How confident are you in the gap analysis, and what verification would you need?

### Task 3: Citation Network Analysis
Use Semantic Scholar's citation tools to analyze the intellectual lineage of important papers.

**Steps:**
1. Identify 1-2 seminal or highly relevant papers in your field
2. In Semantic Scholar:
   - Examine papers that cite your selected paper(s)
   - Identify "highly influential" citations
   - Explore citation contexts to understand how the paper is used
   - Examine the references of your paper to trace intellectual foundations
   - Look for citation patterns: clusters of related work
3. Use Elicit to enhance understanding:
   - Ask about connections between papers you've identified
   - Request summaries of key papers in the citation network
   - Ask about methodological developments across the network
4. Create a brief map of the citation network:
   - Foundational papers
   - Key developments
   - Recent extensions
   - Competing approaches or interpretations

**Reflection Questions:**
- What intellectual lineages did you discover in your field?
- How has the original research been extended or challenged?
- What does the citation pattern reveal about evolving research priorities?
- Which citation connections were most surprising or informative?

### Task 4: Methodological Analysis
Compare methodological approaches in your field using both tools.

**Steps:**
1. In Elicit:
   - Ask: "What methodological approaches are used to study [your topic]?"
   - Request: "Compare quantitative and qualitative methods for researching [your topic]"
   - Inquire: "What are the strengths and limitations of different methods for studying [your topic]?"
   - Look for emerging or innovative methods mentioned
2. In Semantic Scholar:
   - Search for "[your topic]" AND "methodology" OR "method"
   - Filter for review papers that might compare approaches
   - Look for methodological debates or controversies
   - Identify trends in methodology over time
3. Create a methodological comparison table:
   - List major methodological approaches
   - Note strengths and limitations of each
   - Identify typical research questions addressed by each
   - Note influential papers using each approach

**Reflection Questions:**
- What methodological trends are emerging in your field?
- Which methodological approaches seem most appropriate for your research questions?
- What methodological debates or controversies exist in your field?
- How might you combine or innovate on existing methodologies?

### Task 5: Cross-Disciplinary Connections
Identify how research in other fields might inform your work.

**Steps:**
1. In Elicit:
   - Ask: "How is [your topic] studied in fields outside of [your discipline]?"
   - Inquire: "What concepts from [another field] have been applied to [your topic]?"
   - Request: "Identify interdisciplinary approaches to studying [your topic]"
   - Look for unexpected connections and novel frameworks
2. In Semantic Scholar:
   - Use field filters to explore your topic across different disciplines
   - Search for "[your topic]" AND "interdisciplinary"
   - Look for papers with authors from multiple departments
   - Identify papers that bridge disciplinary boundaries
3. Create an interdisciplinary concept map:
   - Your core topic at the center
   - Connected disciplines and their approaches
   - Key concepts borrowed across boundaries
   - Potential novel connections not yet explored

**Reflection Questions:**
- Which other disciplines offer valuable perspectives on your research area?
- What methodological approaches from other fields might you adapt?
- What conceptual frameworks from other disciplines could enhance your work?
- What barriers might exist to interdisciplinary integration in your field?

### Task 6: Research Trend Analysis
Identify emerging trends and shifting focus in your research area.

**Steps:**
1. In Semantic Scholar:
   - Search for your core topic
   - Apply date filters to compare different time periods
   - Compare highly cited papers from different years
   - Look for emerging keywords and concepts
2. In Elicit:
   - Ask: "What are emerging trends in research on [your topic] in the last 3 years?"
   - Request: "How has research on [your topic] evolved over the past decade?"
   - Inquire: "What new methodologies are being applied to [your topic]?"
   - Look for shifts in research questions and approaches
3. Create a research evolution timeline:
   - Key papers and developments
   - Shifting research questions
   - Methodological innovations
   - Emerging subtopics
   - Declining areas of focus

**Reflection Questions:**
- How has the focus of research in your field shifted over time?
- What new questions or approaches are gaining traction?
- Which traditional approaches are being challenged or reimagined?
- How might these trends influence your research direction?

   - Record key papers discovered
   - Note strengths and limitations of each platform
   - Capture insights about your research area

2. **Develop an integrated workflow**:
   - Create a personal process map for literature discovery
   - Define when to use each tool in your research process
   - Establish a system for managing papers across platforms
   - Plan how to incorporate these tools into your existing workflow

3. **Prepare to share**:
   - One effective search strategy or technique
   - One unexpected discovery about your research area
   - One proposed integration into your research workflow

## Extension Activities (If Time Permits)

If you complete your chosen tasks with additional time:

1. **Test advanced search operators** in Semantic Scholar to refine your search precision

## Reflection and Application Planning

Before concluding this session, take 5 minutes to reflect on:

1. **How these tools complement each other** in your research workflow
2. **Specific research tasks** where each tool offers unique advantages
3. **Verification and quality control steps** needed when using these tools
4. **Immediate applications** to your current research projects
5. **Training needs** to further develop your skills with these platforms

Document these reflections as part of your course portfolio to track your development of an integrated AI research toolkit.
