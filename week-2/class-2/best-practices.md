# Research Tool Best Practices Checklist
## Week 2, Class 4

Use this checklist to ensure you're getting the most value from Elicit, Semantic Scholar, and other research tools while maintaining research integrity.

## ✓ Literature Search Strategy

- [ ] **Begin with clear research questions** before searching
- [ ] **Try multiple search formulations** for comprehensive results
- [ ] **Use field-specific terminology** for more relevant results
- [ ] **Document your search parameters** for reproducibility
- [ ] **Combine broad and narrow searches** for depth and breadth
- [ ] **Use multiple tools** to compensate for individual limitations
- [ ] **Track search iterations** and how they evolved
- [ ] **Set alerts for new publications** in your research area

## ✓ Elicit Best Practices

- [ ] **Phrase queries as specific questions** rather than keywords
- [ ] **Include methodological preferences** when relevant
- [ ] **Use comparative language** for finding contrasting approaches
- [ ] **Verify AI-generated summaries** against original abstracts
- [ ] **Check extraction accuracy** for critical information
- [ ] **Save useful searches** for future reference
- [ ] **Export citations** in your preferred format
- [ ] **Report inaccuracies** to improve the system

## ✓ Semantic Scholar Best Practices

- [ ] **Use advanced search operators** for precision
- [ ] **Leverage citation analysis** to find influential papers
- [ ] **Explore citation contexts** to understand paper influence
- [ ] **Follow citation paths** in both directions
- [ ] **Track key authors** in your research area
- [ ] **Compare papers across time periods** to identify trends
- [ ] **Create an account** to save papers and searches
- [ ] **Set up research feeds** for automated updates

## ✓ Critical Evaluation

- [ ] **Look beyond citation counts** for quality assessment
- [ ] **Consider recency vs. influence** when evaluating papers
- [ ] **Verify methodological soundness** independent of metrics
- [ ] **Identify potential biases** in study design and reporting
- [ ] **Cross-check findings** across multiple sources
- [ ] **Consider conflicting evidence** fairly
- [ ] **Evaluate practical significance** not just statistical significance
- [ ] **Assess applicability to your specific context**

## ✓ Comprehensive Coverage

- [ ] **Use multiple research tools** with different strengths
- [ ] **Check field-specific databases** beyond general tools
- [ ] **Include gray literature** when appropriate
- [ ] **Consider international research** beyond English-language sources
- [ ] **Look for contrasting viewpoints** and methodologies
- [ ] **Include older seminal works** alongside recent studies
- [ ] **Examine interdisciplinary connections** to your topic
- [ ] **Check for preprints** and forthcoming research

## ✓ Effective Organization

- [ ] **Maintain consistent citation format** across sources
- [ ] **Use a reference manager** for organization
- [ ] **Create thematic categories** for literature organization
- [ ] **Document methodological characteristics** of key studies
- [ ] **Note strengths and limitations** of important papers
- [ ] **Track contradictory findings** and possible explanations
- [ ] **Maintain a chronological perspective** on research evolution
- [ ] **Create synthesis notes** connecting related studies

## ✓ Research Integrity

- [ ] **Verify AI-generated content** against original sources
- [ ] **Cite primary sources** rather than AI summaries
- [ ] **Acknowledge tool use** in research methods
- [ ] **Maintain critical thinking** when evaluating AI-suggested relevance
- [ ] **Consider what might be missing** from automated results
- [ ] **Follow institutional guidelines** on AI tool use
- [ ] **Maintain transparent research practices**
- [ ] **Distinguish your analysis** from tool-generated content

## ✓ Tool Integration Workflow

- [ ] **Use Elicit** for initial discovery and summaries
- [ ] **Use Semantic Scholar** for citation analysis and tracking
- [ ] **Use NotebookLM** for deeper reading and note organization
- [ ] **Use general AI assistants** for synthesis and question-answering
- [ ] **Use reference managers** for citation organization
- [ ] **Document transitions** between tools
- [ ] **Maintain consistent paper identification** across platforms
- [ ] **Develop standard operating procedures** for your research workflow

## ✓ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- [ ] **Over-reliance on a single tool** or approach
- [ ] **Accepting AI summaries** without verification
- [ ] **Citation hunting** without critical evaluation
- [ ] **Ignoring methodological details** in favor of conclusions
- [ ] **Confirmation bias** in search and selection
- [ ] **Neglecting contrary evidence** or limitations
- [ ] **Using inappropriate search terms** for your field
- [ ] **Failing to document** your search and evaluation process

## ✓ Advanced Practices

- [ ] **Conduct systematic gap analysis** to identify research opportunities
- [ ] **Map the evolution of concepts** over time
- [ ] **Analyze methodological trends** in your research area
- [ ] **Identify paradigm shifts** through citation analysis
- [ ] **Track research communities** through co-citation analysis
- [ ] **Document theoretical developments** chronologically
- [ ] **Compare competing frameworks** systematically
- [ ] **Create visual maps** of the literature landscape
