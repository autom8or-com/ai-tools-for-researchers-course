# Guided Practice Activities: Elicit and Semantic Scholar
## Week 2, Class 4

These activities are designed to be completed in class with instructor guidance. They will help you develop hands-on experience with Elicit and Semantic Scholar for research tasks.

## Activity Duration: 30 minutes

---

## Activity 1: Setting Up and Basic Search (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Create accounts and conduct parallel searches on both platforms to compare results.

**Instructions:**
1. Open both [Elicit](https://elicit.org) and [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) in separate browser tabs
2. Create accounts on both platforms (or login if you already have accounts)
3. Choose a research topic relevant to your field
4. In Elicit, phrase your topic as a question: "What are the effects of [topic] on [outcome]?"
5. In Semantic Scholar, enter key terms related to your topic
6. Compare the first page of results from both platforms

**Discussion Points:**
- How do the results differ between the two platforms?
- Which platform returned more recent research?
- Which platform provided more contextual information about the papers?
- What types of papers (methodology, focus) appeared in each platform?

## Activity 2: Advanced Search Techniques (7-8 minutes)

**Objective:** Learn how to use advanced search features on both platforms to find more specific research.

**Instructions:**

### For Elicit:
1. Refine your previous search by adding methodological specifications:
   - Add "randomized controlled trials" or "qualitative studies" to your query
   - Specify a population: "in adults" or "in educational settings"
   - Add a time element: "in the last five years" or "long-term effects"
2. Note how the results change with these specifications

### For Semantic Scholar:
1. Use advanced search operators:
   - Add author:"[prominent researcher in field]" to your search
   - Restrict by year: year:2018-2023
   - Use quotes for exact phrases: "machine learning"
   - Combine with Boolean operators: AND, OR, NOT
2. Apply filters from the left sidebar (publication types, venues, etc.)

**Discussion Points:**
- How did the specificity of your search affect the results?
- Which platform handled advanced search features more effectively?
- What types of filters were most useful for narrowing your results?
- How might these advanced techniques improve your literature search efficiency?

## Activity 3: Exploring Paper Details and Analysis (7-8 minutes)

**Objective:** Practice examining paper details and using the analytical features of both platforms.

**Instructions:**

### For Elicit:
1. Select an interesting paper from your search results
2. Examine Elicit's automatic summary features:
   - Research question extraction
   - Methodology summary
   - Key findings summary
   - Limitations extraction
3. Try the comparison feature:
   - Select 2-3 papers on similar topics
   - Look for the compare option
   - Review how Elicit presents the comparison

### For Semantic Scholar:
1. Select a highly-cited paper from your search results
2. Explore the paper's page:
   - Note the citation count and "Highly Influential Citations"
   - Examine the citation velocity graph
   - Look at related papers and recommendations
   - Review any available citation contexts
3. Click on the "Citations" tab to see papers that cite this work
4. Click on the "References" tab to see works cited by this paper

**Discussion Points:**
- How useful were Elicit's automatic summaries? How accurate?
- What insights did Semantic Scholar's citation analysis provide?
- Which platform gave you a better understanding of the paper's importance?
- How might these features change your literature review process?

## Activity 4: Research Organization and Export (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Learn how to save, organize, and export research findings from both platforms.

**Instructions:**

### For Elicit:
1. Save 2-3 papers that seem most relevant to your research
2. Create a simple organization system (if the platform allows)
3. Find and use the export feature to download citations
4. Explore any note-taking or summarization export options

### For Semantic Scholar:
1. Save 2-3 papers to your library
2. Organize them into a collection or with tags (if available)
3. Export the citations in your preferred format (BibTeX, RIS, etc.)
4. Explore author following or alert features

**Discussion Points:**
- How do the organizational features compare between platforms?
- Which export options are most useful for your workflow?
- How would you integrate these saved papers into your existing reference management system?
- What features would improve your research organization process?

## Activity 5: Comparative Analysis and Integration (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Develop strategies for using both tools together in a complementary research workflow.

**Instructions:**
1. Reflect on the strengths and limitations of each platform
2. For your specific research topic, outline a workflow that uses both tools:
   - Which tool would you start with and why?
   - At what point would you switch to the other tool?
   - What unique value does each tool provide?
   - How would you avoid duplication of effort?
3. Identify gaps that neither tool addresses for your research needs
4. Consider how to integrate these tools with others (NotebookLM, reference managers, etc.)

**Discussion Points:**
- What are the complementary strengths of these tools?
- How might the order of using these tools affect your research process?
- What types of research questions are best suited for each platform?
- How would you document your search process across multiple platforms?

## Closing Reflection (2-3 minutes)

Take a moment to jot down:
1. One specific way Elicit could enhance your research process
2. One specific way Semantic Scholar could enhance your research process
3. One strategy for combining these tools effectively
4. One limitation you'll need to address through other methods

Share your reflections with a colleague or in the class discussion.

## Instructor Notes

- Encourage students to use research topics directly relevant to their work
- Be prepared to troubleshoot account creation issues
- Highlight the different philosophies behind the two platforms:
  - Elicit: AI-first approach focused on extraction and summary
  - Semantic Scholar: Search-first approach with citation intelligence
- Emphasize complementary use rather than choosing one over the other
- Collect examples of particularly effective searches or workflows to share
