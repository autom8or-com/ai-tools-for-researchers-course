- Leverage advanced search operators
- Use filters strategically
- Follow citation trails from seminal papers

### Citation Network Exploration

2. Examine its citation network in both directions:
   - What foundational works did it cite?
   - What recent works build upon it?
3. Identify clusters of related research
4. Map the evolution of ideas through citation paths

### Complementary Tools Approach
- Use Semantic Scholar for citation analysis and discovery
- Combine with Elicit for paper summaries
- Use NotebookLM for deeper reading and notes
- Integrate with reference managers for organization
- Document your cross-tool research workflow

### Verification and Validation
- Cross-check important citation counts with other sources
- Verify paper categorization and field assignments
- Remember that metrics are indicators, not definitive measures
- Consider field-specific citation patterns
- Always critically evaluate papers regardless of metrics

## 11. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Missing or Incomplete Papers
- Check alternative spellings or formulations
- Verify publication details
- Search by DOI if available
- Try author search instead
- Consider recency (very new papers may not be indexed yet)

### Citation Count Discrepancies
- Different databases count citations differently
- Some citations may be from preprints or non-traditional sources
- Citation counts are regularly updated but not in real-time
- Field-specific citation practices vary widely

### Access to Full Text
- Try the alternative sources listed
- Check your institutional access
- Look for open access versions
- Consider Unpaywall browser extension for finding legal open access versions
- Use your library's interlibrary loan service if needed

### Account Issues
