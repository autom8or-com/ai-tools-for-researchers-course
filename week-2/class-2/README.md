# Week 2, Class 2: Elicit and Semantic Scholar
## AI-Powered Research Tools for Literature Discovery and Analysis

This session focuses on two powerful AI-enhanced research tools: Elicit and Semantic Scholar. These tools will help you discover relevant literature, analyze citation networks, identify research gaps, and integrate findings into your research workflow.

## Materials

### Presentation and Teaching Resources
- [Presentation Slides](slides.md): Introduction to Elicit and Semantic Scholar
- [Elicit Tutorial](elicit-tutorial.md): Step-by-step guide to using Elicit
- [Semantic Scholar Tutorial](semantic-scholar-tutorial.md): Step-by-step guide to using Semantic Scholar
- [Best Practices Checklist](best-practices.md): Maximize your effectiveness with these tools

### Hands-On Practice
- [Guided Practice Activities](guided-practice.md): Instructor-led exercises with both tools
- [Independent Work Activities](independent-work.md): Apply these tools to your research
- [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md): Solutions for common challenges

### Assessment
- [Week 2 Assessment](assessment.md): Compare and integrate Elicit and Semantic Scholar into your workflow

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this class, you will be able to:
1. Compare AI-powered literature search tools with traditional databases
2. Use Elicit effectively for research question exploration and paper discovery
3. Leverage Semantic Scholar for citation analysis and research mapping
4. Develop integrated workflows that combine multiple research tools
5. Apply appropriate verification and validation strategies for AI-assisted research
