## Research Workflows: When to Use Each Tool

### Elicit
- Initial exploration of new research areas
- Quick answers to specific research questions
- Generating research ideas and questions
- Extracting structured information across papers
- Comparing methodological approaches

---

## Research Workflows: When to Use Each Tool

### Semantic Scholar
- Comprehensive literature searches
- Citation network mapping
- Tracking influential papers
- Author-focused exploration
- Field-level trends and patterns
- Finding the most recent work on a topic

---

## Research Workflows: Complementary Approaches

**Combined Workflow Example:**
1. Use Elicit to identify key questions and initial papers
2. Explore citation networks in Semantic Scholar
3. Return to Elicit for targeted information extraction
4. Use NotebookLM for deep reading of key papers
5. Create synthesis notes integrating insights from all tools

---

## Effective Search Strategies: Elicit

- **Phrase as questions** rather than keywords
- **Specify methodology** when relevant
- **Include field context**: "in cognitive psychology..."
- **Define population**: "...in adolescents"
- **Specify time period**: "...in the last five years"
- **Compare approaches**: "What are different methods for measuring X?"
- **Seek contrasts**: "What are competing theories of Y?"

---

## Effective Search Strategies: Semantic Scholar

- **Use advanced operators**: author:, year:, AND, OR, NOT
- **Leverage exact phrases** with quotation marks
- **Apply multiple filters** strategically
- **Follow citation paths** both backward and forward
- **Use field tags** to narrow scope
- **Explore related papers** for serendipitous discovery
- **Track key authors** in your field

---

## Information Verification Workflow

1. Use AI tools for initial discovery and triage
2. Verify key findings against original abstracts
3. Access full text for critical papers
4. Cross-check across multiple sources
5. Evaluate methodological quality independently
6. Consider what might be missing from results
7. Document limitations in AI-assisted research

---

## Paper Management Best Practices

- **Consistent naming conventions** across platforms
- **Tag papers** with standardized categories
- **Export citations** in consistent formats
- **Use reference managers** for centralized organization
- **Document search strategies** for reproducibility
- **Create custom collections** by subtopic
- **Maintain annotation systems** across platforms

---

## Integrating with Reference Managers

- Export citations in standard formats (BibTeX, RIS)
- Import to Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote, etc.
- Maintain consistent metadata across systems
- Link back to discovery platform when needed
- Annotate source of discovery for tracking
- Create separate collections for different discovery methods
- Use tags to mark verification status

---

## Ethical and Practical Considerations

- **Verification responsibility**: Always check AI-produced summaries
- **Algorithmic bias**: Consider what might be missing or overrepresented
- **Citation ethics**: Cite original papers, not AI summaries
- **Research documentation**: Document AI tool use in methods
- **Transparency**: Be open about AI-assisted discovery
- **False precision**: Recognize limitations in extraction accuracy
- **Researcher judgment**: Maintain critical evaluation of all sources

---

## Current Limitations to Be Aware Of

- **Coverage gaps**: Different disciplinary coverage across platforms
- **Recency limitations**: Delays in indexing new publications
- **Extraction errors**: AI misinterpretation of complex content
- **Discipline bias**: Better performance in some fields than others
- **Full text limitations**: Analysis often based on abstracts only
- **Interface changes**: Rapid evolution of features and capabilities
- **Non-traditional outputs**: Limited coverage of books, reports, etc.
