## Task 1: NotebookLM Research Notebook Setup (20%)

### Instructions:
1. Create a NotebookLM notebook focused on a specific research topic in your field
2. Upload 3-5 scholarly articles or papers relevant to your chosen topic
3. Document the setup process and organization approach

### Deliverable:
Submit a brief report (300-400 words) with screenshots that includes:
- Description of your research topic and focus
- List of uploaded papers with full citations
- Screenshot of your notebook organization
- Explanation of your organizational approach
- Any challenges encountered during setup and how you addressed them
- Initial observations about NotebookLM's document processing capabilities

## Task 2: Literature Analysis and Synthesis (35%)

### Instructions:
Using your NotebookLM notebook with uploaded papers:
1. Conduct at least 5 different types of analyses, such as:
   - Comparing methodological approaches across papers
   - Identifying theoretical frameworks used
   - Synthesizing key findings
   - Analyzing research gaps
   - Examining definitions of key concepts
   - Evaluating evidence quality
2. Save your analyses as organized notes within NotebookLM
3. Create at least one synthesis note that integrates information across multiple papers

### Deliverable:
Submit a document that includes:
- Screenshots of your 5+ analysis questions and NotebookLM's responses
- Screenshots of your saved notes with proper citations
- A 400-500 word critical evaluation of NotebookLM's analysis capabilities, addressing:
  - Accuracy of information extraction and synthesis
  - Quality of cross-document connections
  - Appropriateness of citations
  - Strengths and limitations for literature analysis in your field
  - Comparison with how you might have done this analysis manually

## Task 3: Research Framework Development (25%)

### Instructions:
Use NotebookLM to help develop one of the following research frameworks based on your uploaded literature:
1. A methodological framework for your research area
2. A theoretical or conceptual framework synthesizing key theories
3. A research gap analysis framework
4. A structured literature review outline
5. A comparative evaluation framework for studies in your field

### Deliverable:
Submit:
- Screenshots of the prompts/questions you used to generate the framework
- Screenshot(s) of the resulting framework from NotebookLM
- A 300-word explanation of how you would use this framework in your research
- A brief assessment (200 words) of what aspects of the framework were well-developed by NotebookLM and what aspects required your own refinement

## Task 4: Reflection and Integration (20%)

### Instructions:
1. Export at least one substantial note or framework from NotebookLM
2. Reflect on how NotebookLM compares to other literature organization methods
3. Consider how you might integrate NotebookLM into your existing research workflow

### Deliverable:
Write a reflection (500-600 words) addressing:
- Benefits and limitations of NotebookLM compared to traditional literature review methods
- Benefits and limitations compared to general AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT) for literature analysis
- How NotebookLM might complement other tools in your research process
- Specific research tasks for which you would or would not use NotebookLM
- Potential integration challenges with your existing workflow
- How you might address the tool's limitations in your research practice

## Submission Guidelines

Your submission should include:
1. A title page with your name, field of research, and date
2. All four tasks clearly labeled with appropriate headings
3. Screenshots embedded within the document at relevant points
4. Your analyses and reflections in well-structured paragraphs
5. Proper citations for all papers used in your NotebookLM notebook
