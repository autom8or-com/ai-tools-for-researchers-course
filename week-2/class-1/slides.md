---

## What is NotebookLM?

- An AI-powered research notebook by Google
- Designed specifically for working with documents
- Allows direct interaction with source materials
- Functions as both a reading environment and thinking space
- Maintains citations and references to sources

---

## Key Features for Researchers

- Upload and analyze PDF research papers
- Ask questions directly about your documents
- Automatic organization of key information
- Create custom notes linked to sources
- Generate insights across multiple papers
- Collaborate with colleagues (limited functionality)

---

## How NotebookLM Differs from General AI Assistants

- Document-centric rather than conversation-centric
- "Reads" your documents instead of working from general knowledge
- Maintains direct connections to source material
- Designed for deeper exploration of specific content
- Focuses on accurate attribution and sourcing

---

## NotebookLM Workspace Structure

- Notebooks: Main organizational units for projects
- Sources: Your uploaded documents
- Notes: AI-generated or user-created content
- Sparks: AI-generated insights and suggestions
- Citations: Automatic tracking of information sources

---

## Setting Up Your First Notebook
