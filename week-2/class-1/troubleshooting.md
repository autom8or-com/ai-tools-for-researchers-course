3. **Refine your questions**: Be more specific about what you're asking
4. **Ask for clarification**: Have the AI explain contradictions it identifies
5. **Use direct quotes**: Ask the AI to quote relevant sections directly

## Cross-Document Analysis Issues

### Problem: Poor Connections Between Documents

**Possible Causes:**
- Different terminology across papers
- Complex relationships between concepts
- Limited context understanding by AI
- Too many documents for effective synthesis

**Solutions:**
1. **Reduce document set**: Focus on fewer, more closely related papers
2. **Use explicit connection prompts**: Ask specifically how concepts connect
3. **Create intermediate notes**: Build up connections gradually
4. **Provide context**: Include key terms or concepts in your questions
5. **Focus on specific themes**: Ask about specific themes across papers

### Problem: Inconsistent Analysis Across Documents

**Possible Causes:**
- Varying document quality
- Different writing styles or terminology
- Complex or specialized content
- Limitations in AI's synthesis capabilities

**Solutions:**
1. **Standardize document quality**: Ensure all documents are similar in format and quality
2. **Use consistent terminology**: Frame questions using consistent terminology
3. **Break down comparisons**: Compare specific aspects rather than entire papers
4. **Create structured templates**: Ask for specific elements across all documents
5. **Verify comparisons**: Check that comparisons accurately reflect source content

## Note Organization Issues

### Problem: Difficulty Managing Multiple Notes

**Possible Causes:**
- Lack of consistent naming conventions
- Too many unstructured notes
- Limited organization features
- No clear categorization system

**Solutions:**
1. **Use consistent naming**: Adopt a clear naming convention (e.g., "Topic - Subtopic - Date")
2. **Create index notes**: Make overview notes that link to detailed notes
3. **Use hierarchical organization**: Group related notes together
4. **Add metadata**: Include tags or categories in note titles
5. **Regular cleanup**: Periodically review and consolidate notes

### Problem: Incomplete or Inaccurate Citations

**Possible Causes:**
- AI limitations in processing references
- Complex citation formats in original documents
