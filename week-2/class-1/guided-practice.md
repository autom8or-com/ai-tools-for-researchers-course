## Activity 1: NotebookLM Setup and Navigation (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Create a NotebookLM account and become familiar with the basic interface.

**Instructions:**
1. Visit [notebooklm.google.com](https://notebooklm.google.com)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Complete any onboarding steps
4. Explore the main dashboard interface
5. Create a new notebook titled "Research Methods Review"
6. Add a brief description: "Analyzing methodological approaches in my field"

**Discussion Points:**
- How does the NotebookLM interface differ from conversational AI assistants?
- What are your initial impressions of the organization and layout?
- Any challenges encountered during setup?

## Activity 2: Document Upload and Processing (7-8 minutes)

**Objective:** Learn how to upload research papers and understand how NotebookLM processes them.

**Instructions:**
1. Download the sample papers provided in the course materials (or use 1-2 papers from your own research field)
2. In your "Research Methods Review" notebook:
   - Click "Add Source" or "+" button
   - Upload the PDF file(s)
   - Observe the processing indicators
3. While processing occurs, review document requirements and limitations
4. Once processing completes, open one of the documents
5. Explore the document view interface:
   - Navigation options
   - Highlighting tools
   - Page navigation

**Discussion Points:**
- What information does NotebookLM provide about document processing?
- How is the document displayed compared to a standard PDF viewer?
- What limitations did you notice in document handling?

## Activity 3: Basic Document Questioning (7-8 minutes)

**Objective:** Practice asking basic questions about uploaded document content.

**Instructions:**
1. With a document open in your notebook, locate the question box
2. Ask these basic questions one at a time:
   - "What is the main research question in this paper?"
   - "Summarize the methodology used in this study."
   - "What are the key findings of this research?"
3. For each response:
   - Note how NotebookLM cites specific sections of the document
   - Verify the response against the actual document content
   - Observe any strengths or limitations in the AI's understanding

**Discussion Points:**
- How accurate were the responses to your questions?
- How does NotebookLM handle citations differently from general AI assistants?
- What types of questions seem to work best?

## Activity 4: Creating AI-Generated Notes (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Learn how to create and organize AI-generated notes with proper citations.

**Instructions:**
1. From either the document view or main notebook interface:
   - Click "Create Note" or equivalent button
   - Choose the AI-assisted note option if available
2. Enter one of these prompts:
   - "Create a structured summary of the methodology section of this paper."
   - "Identify and summarize the key theoretical frameworks used in this paper."
3. Review the generated note:
   - Observe how citations are included
   - Check the accuracy of the content
   - Note the structure and organization
4. Add a title to your note and save it
5. Explore options for editing or expanding the note

**Discussion Points:**
- How does the note format differ from direct question responses?
- What are the advantages of saving insights as notes rather than just questions?
- How might you modify the AI-generated note to better serve your research needs?

## Activity 5: Cross-Document Analysis (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Practice comparative analysis across multiple documents.

**Instructions:**
1. From the main notebook view (ensure you have at least two documents uploaded):
2. Ask a comparative question such as:
   - "Compare the methodological approaches used in these papers."
   - "What are the main similarities and differences in how these papers approach their research questions?"
   - "How do the theoretical frameworks differ between these papers?"
3. Observe how NotebookLM synthesizes information across documents
4. Note the citation practices for multi-document references
5. Create a note to save this comparative analysis

**Discussion Points:**
- How effectively does NotebookLM connect information across documents?
- What are the challenges in cross-document analysis?
- How might this feature support literature review development?

---

## Closing Reflection (2-3 minutes)

Take a moment to consider:
1. One specific way NotebookLM might enhance your research literature review process
2. One limitation you observed that you'll need to work around
3. How NotebookLM differs from using a general AI assistant for literature analysis

Share your reflections with a colleague or in the class discussion.
