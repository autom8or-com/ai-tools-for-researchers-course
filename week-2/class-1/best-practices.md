# NotebookLM Best Practices Checklist
## Week 2, Class 3

Use this checklist to maximize the effectiveness of NotebookLM for your research literature organization and analysis.

## ✓ Document Preparation

- [ ] **Use text-searchable PDFs** with proper OCR for scanned documents
- [ ] **Select high-quality papers** with clear structure and formatting
- [ ] **Organize documents thematically** before uploading
- [ ] **Consider file size limitations** (typically under 50MB per file)
- [ ] **Check document language support** before uploading
- [ ] **Prepare papers with clear section headings** for better AI recognition
- [ ] **Convert complex tables or figures** into more accessible formats if needed
- [ ] **Verify document text is selectable** rather than image-based

## ✓ Notebook Organization

- [ ] **Create focused, topic-specific notebooks** rather than one large repository
- [ ] **Add clear descriptions** to notebooks for easy reference
- [ ] **Limit initial uploads** to 5-10 key papers before scaling up
- [ ] **Use consistent naming conventions** for notebooks and notes
- [ ] **Create thematic organization** for papers within notebooks
- [ ] **Add metadata** in descriptions (project, date, purpose)
- [ ] **Consider document relationships** when organizing notebooks
- [ ] **Create index notes** that link to other detailed notes

## ✓ Effective Questioning

- [ ] **Ask specific, focused questions** rather than broad inquiries
- [ ] **Target questions to specific sections** when appropriate
- [ ] **Use clear, concise language** in your questions
- [ ] **Break complex inquiries** into multiple simpler questions
- [ ] **Include relevant terminology** from your field
- [ ] **Request specific citation information** for important points
- [ ] **Ask comparative questions** to identify patterns across papers
- [ ] **Vary question phrasing** if initial results are unsatisfactory

## ✓ Note Creation and Management

- [ ] **Save important insights** as notes rather than just questions
- [ ] **Create structured note templates** for consistent analysis
- [ ] **Include proper citations** in all notes
- [ ] **Verify AI-generated content** against original sources
- [ ] **Edit AI-generated notes** to improve accuracy and relevance
- [ ] **Use consistent naming conventions** for notes
- [ ] **Organize notes hierarchically** when possible
- [ ] **Create synthesis notes** that integrate multiple sources

## ✓ Cross-Document Analysis

- [ ] **Start with closely related papers** for better synthesis
- [ ] **Ask explicit questions about relationships** between papers
- [ ] **Look for thematic connections** across documents
- [ ] **Compare methodological approaches** systematically
- [ ] **Identify contradictions and agreements** across literature
- [ ] **Create comparative tables** for structured analysis
- [ ] **Develop concept maps** showing relationships between ideas
- [ ] **Track citation relationships** across your document set

## ✓ Content Verification

- [ ] **Always check AI responses** against original document text
- [ ] **Verify all citations** and page references
- [ ] **Be especially careful with numerical data** extraction
- [ ] **Cross-check interpretations** of complex or technical content
- [ ] **Manually verify information from figures or tables**
- [ ] **Check for content omissions** that might affect conclusions
- [ ] **Consider alternative interpretations** of ambiguous text
- [ ] **Note any AI limitations** encountered for future reference

## ✓ Research Integration

- [ ] **Export important notes** in appropriate formats
- [ ] **Document your NotebookLM methodology** for research transparency
- [ ] **Cite original sources** rather than NotebookLM's summaries
- [ ] **Create a verification protocol** for AI-assisted insights
- [ ] **Use NotebookLM analysis** as a starting point, not final analysis
- [ ] **Integrate with reference management software** for citation tracking
- [ ] **Combine with other research tools** for comprehensive analysis
- [ ] **Apply critical thinking** to all AI-generated content

## ✓ Workflow Optimization

- [ ] **Create standard procedures** for regular research tasks
- [ ] **Document effective prompts** for future use
- [ ] **Establish a regular review process** for notebooks
- [ ] **Archive completed projects** appropriately
- [ ] **Develop templates** for different research activities
- [ ] **Share best practices** with colleagues
- [ ] **Track time savings** to measure productivity improvements
- [ ] **Regularly update your approach** as the platform evolves

## ✓ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- [ ] **Overreliance on AI interpretation** without verification
- [ ] **Uploading too many documents** at once
- [ ] **Using poor quality documents** with format issues
- [ ] **Asking overly broad questions** that yield generic responses
- [ ] **Neglecting to save important insights** as notes
- [ ] **Accepting incomplete analyses** without follow-up
- [ ] **Ignoring platform limitations** for specialized content
- [ ] **Failing to document your methodology** for research transparency

## ✓ Advanced Techniques

- [ ] **Create multi-step analytical workflows** for complex analyses
- [ ] **Develop comparative frameworks** for systematic literature comparison
- [ ] **Build theoretical models** based on literature synthesis
- [ ] **Create research gap analyses** across document sets
- [ ] **Develop methodological taxonomies** for your field
- [ ] **Map concept evolution** across chronological literature
- [ ] **Track evidence quality** systematically across studies
- [ ] **Create literature review structures** based on thematic analysis
