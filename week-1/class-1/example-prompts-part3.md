## 3. Methodology Planning

### Prompt:
```
I'm planning a mixed-methods study on teacher burnout during COVID-19. I want to use surveys followed by in-depth interviews. Can you outline the key methodological considerations I should address, potential pitfalls to avoid, and how I might effectively combine quantitative and qualitative data in my analysis?

# Methodological Considerations for Mixed-Methods Study on Teacher Burnout

## Survey Design (Quantitative Component)
- **Measurement instruments**: Consider validated scales like Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) or Copenhagen Burnout Inventory for your core measurements
- **Sample size considerations**: Aim for sufficient power based on planned analyses (generally 100+ participants for meaningful quantitative analysis)
- **Sampling strategy**: How to ensure representative sample across different school types, geographical regions, grade levels taught
- **Variables to include**: Demographics, teaching experience, remote vs. in-person teaching, administrative support, technical resources, student engagement metrics

## Interview Protocol (Qualitative Component)
- **Participant selection**: Consider purposive sampling based on survey results (e.g., high/medium/low burnout scores)
- **Sample size**: Typically 15-30 participants or until reaching data saturation
- **Interview structure**: Semi-structured is recommended to balance consistency with exploration
- **Question development**: Use survey findings to inform interview questions

## Integration Strategy
- **Sequential explanatory design**: Use survey results to:
  - Identify patterns requiring deeper explanation
  - Select representative interview participants
  - Develop targeted interview questions
- **Data triangulation**: Plan how survey findings will be compared with interview themes

## Potential Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Selection bias**: Teachers experiencing severe burnout might be less likely to participate
- **Timing sensitivity**: Teacher workload varies throughout school year; timing of data collection matters
- **Retrospective recall issues**: Consider longitudinal components if possible
- **Survey fatigue**: Keep surveys concise given teachers' limited time
- **Leading questions**: Ensure neutrality in interview protocol
- **Insufficient integration**: Avoid conducting two parallel studies rather than a truly integrated design

## Effective Data Combination Strategies
- **Joint displays**: Create tables/matrices that present quantitative results alongside supporting qualitative themes
- **Case profiles**: Develop detailed profiles of individuals representing different burnout patterns
- **Typology development**: Use survey data to create burnout typologies, then use interviews to develop rich descriptions of each type
- **Process tracing**: Use interviews to identify mechanisms behind correlations found in survey data
- **Contradictory data analysis**: Develop protocol for investigating and interpreting when qualitative findings contradict quantitative results

## Analysis Approach
- **Quantitative**: Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, regression models, potentially factor analysis
- **Qualitative**: Thematic analysis or grounded theory approach
- **Integration**: Consider both data transformation (quantifying qualitative data) and merging strategies

## Ethical Considerations
- **Emotional distress**: Have support resources available for participants
- **Anonymity concerns**: Small schools may make identification possible even with anonymized data
- **Power dynamics**: Consider how school administrators might influence participation
