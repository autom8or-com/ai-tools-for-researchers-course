# Guided Practice Activities: Introduction to AI Assistants

## Activity Duration: 30 minutes

These activities are designed to be completed in class with instructor guidance. They progress from basic to more complex interactions with AI assistants.

---

## Activity 1: First Contact (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Establish a baseline understanding of how AI assistants respond to simple prompts.

**Instructions:**
1. Open your preferred AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, or Deepseek)
2. Enter one of the following simple prompts:
   - "Explain what [concept from your field] means."
   - "What are the main research methods used in [your discipline]?"
3. Review the response and note:
   - Level of detail provided
   - Accuracy of information
   - Tone and style of writing

**Discussion Points:**
- How does the AI's explanation compare to how you would explain the concept?
- What assumptions did the AI make about your background knowledge?
- Did the AI provide citations or references? Were they valid?

## Activity 2: Adding Context and Specificity (5-7 minutes)

**Objective:** Learn how providing context and specific requirements improves responses.

**Instructions:**
1. Take the same topic from Activity 1, but now create a more detailed prompt:
   - "I am a researcher in [your field] preparing materials for undergraduate students. Explain [concept from Activity 1] in simple terms with 2-3 concrete examples. Keep the explanation under 250 words and highlight key terminology."

2. Compare the new response with the one from Activity 1:
   - How did the additional context change the response?
   - Did the AI follow your specific instructions (word count, examples, etc.)?
   - Is the response better suited to your stated purpose?

**Discussion Points:**
- What elements of your prompt had the biggest impact on the response?
- How might you further refine this prompt for better results?

## Activity 3: Research Task Assistance (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Apply AI assistance to a realistic research-related task.

**Instructions:**
1. Choose one of the following research tasks:
   
   **Option A: Literature Review Assistance**
   ```
   I'm starting a literature review on [topic relevant to your field]. Help me:
   1. Identify 5-7 key concepts I should include
   2. Suggest search terms for academic databases
   3. Outline a structure for organizing the literature
   4. Identify potential gaps or controversies in this area
   ```

   **Option B: Research Question Refinement**
   ```
   I'm interested in researching [broad topic]. My initial research question is: "[draft question]". Help me refine this into a more specific, measurable research question. Then suggest methodology approaches that would be appropriate.
   ```

   **Option C: Explaining Complex Concepts**
   ```
   I need to explain [complex concept from your field] to [specific audience - students, colleagues in different field, general public]. Generate an explanation that uses appropriate analogies and avoids jargon. Include a simple graphic or diagram I could create to illustrate this concept.
   ```

2. Submit your chosen prompt to the AI assistant
3. Evaluate the response for usefulness, accuracy, and completeness

**Discussion Points:**
- How would you rate the usefulness of the AI's response for your selected task?
- What elements would you need to verify or elaborate on?
- How might you follow up to get more refined information?

## Activity 4: Iterative Refinement (8-10 minutes)

**Objective:** Practice the iterative process of refining AI responses.

**Instructions:**
1. Based on the response you received in Activity 3, craft a follow-up prompt that does one of the following:
   - Asks for clarification on a specific point
   - Requests more detail in a particular area
   - Suggests a modification to the approach
   - Asks for alternatives or different perspectives

2. Example follow-ups:
   - "Could you elaborate on [specific point] with more examples?"
   - "The [particular section] isn't quite what I need. Could you revise it to focus more on [specific aspect]?"
   - "This is helpful, but could you approach it from a [different theoretical perspective] instead?"
   - "Can you format this as [different format - table, bullets, step-by-step guide]?"

3. Submit your follow-up and evaluate the new response

**Discussion Points:**
- How responsive was the AI to your specific feedback?
- Did the iterative approach yield better results than starting over with a new prompt?
- What strategies for refinement seemed most effective?

## Closing Reflection (2-3 minutes)

Take a moment to jot down:
1. One specific way you could use AI assistants in your current research
2. One limitation you observed during these exercises
3. One prompt strategy you found particularly effective

Share your reflections with a colleague or in the class discussion.

## Instructor Notes

- Circulate during activities to help troubleshoot and observe common patterns
- Encourage participants to compare responses from different AI assistants if time permits
- Emphasize the importance of verification and critical evaluation of AI outputs
- If participants encounter "I can't help with that" responses, use these as teachable moments about AI limitations and how to rephrase requests
