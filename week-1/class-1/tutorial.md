## 3. Your First Interactions

### Basic Structure of a Good Prompt
1. Provide context about who you are
2. Explain what you're trying to accomplish
3. Be specific about the format you want
4. Include relevant details and constraints

### Example:
```
I'm a researcher in molecular biology. I'm trying to explain gene editing techniques to undergraduate students. Can you help me create a simple analogy that compares CRISPR-Cas9 to everyday objects or processes? The analogy should be accessible to students with basic biology knowledge.
```

### Try These Basic Prompts:
1. "Explain [concept from your field] in simple terms."
2. "What are the main research questions in [your field] currently?"
3. "Summarize the key findings from this abstract: [paste abstract]"
4. "Generate 5 potential research questions about [topic]."
