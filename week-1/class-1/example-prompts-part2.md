## 2. Research Question Refinement

### Prompt:
```
I'm interested in how remote work affects employee productivity in the tech industry. My initial research question is: "What is the impact of remote work on productivity?" Help me refine this into a more specific, measurable research question. Then suggest 3 sub-questions that would help answer the main question.
```

### Sample Response:
```
Your initial question provides a good starting point, but it can be refined to be more specific and measurable:

Refined Research Question:
"How does the transition from office-based to remote work influence measurable productivity metrics among software developers in mid-to-large tech companies?"

This refined question:
- Specifies the transition (office to remote)
- Focuses on a specific role (software developers)
- Narrows to a particular industry segment (mid-to-large tech companies)
- Emphasizes measurable metrics rather than subjective impacts

Helpful Sub-questions:

1. "What changes in key performance indicators (such as code commits, bug resolution times, and sprint completion rates) occur during the first six months of transition to remote work compared to the previous six months of office-based work?"

2. "To what extent do collaboration tools and communication practices mediate the relationship between remote work arrangements and team productivity in agile development environments?"

3. "How do individual factors such as home office setup, years of experience, and caregiving responsibilities moderate the effects of remote work on developer productivity and work quality?"

These sub-questions help break down your research into more manageable components, focusing on metrics, mediating factors, and moderating variables respectively.
