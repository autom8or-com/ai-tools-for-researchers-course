# AI Assistant Troubleshooting Guide

This guide addresses common challenges researchers face when using AI assistants and provides practical solutions.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Vague or Unhelpful Responses

**Symptoms:**
- Overly general information
- Superficial analysis
- Lack of specific insights
- Generic advice

**Solutions:**
- **Add specific context** about your field, research question, and background
- **Include examples** of the type of response you're looking for
- **Specify the depth** of analysis you need
- **Indicate your level of expertise** so the AI can calibrate its response
- **Request step-by-step reasoning** rather than just conclusions

**Example Improvement:**
- **Poor prompt:** "Tell me about research methods in psychology."
- **Better prompt:** "I'm a graduate student in clinical psychology designing a study on cognitive behavioral interventions for anxiety disorders. What are the key methodological considerations for randomized controlled trials in this specific domain? Please include sample size considerations, appropriate control conditions, and outcome measurement approaches."

### 2. Factual Inaccuracies

**Symptoms:**
- Information that contradicts established knowledge in your field
- Citations to papers that don't exist
- Incorrect attributions or definitions
- Outdated information

**Solutions:**
- **Always verify facts** independently
- **Challenge the AI** by asking for its source or reasoning
- **Provide correct information** and ask for a revised response
- **Request that the AI indicate uncertainty** when appropriate
- **Use domain-specific prompting** with technical terminology from your field

**Example Improvement:**
- **When you spot an error:** "The information you provided about [specific point] doesn't align with my understanding. My research indicates [correct information]. Can you revise your response based on this information?"

### 3. Refusal to Complete Valid Requests

**Symptoms:**
- Messages stating "I cannot help with that"
- Unnecessary caution about appropriate requests
- Misinterpretation of academic requests as harmful

**Solutions:**
- **Clarify academic context** explicitly
- **Reframe request** to emphasize educational purpose
- **Break complex requests** into smaller components
- **Avoid certain trigger words** that might be misinterpreted
- **Provide clear examples** of what you're looking for

**Example Improvement:**
- **Instead of:** "Write a critique of vaccine hesitancy arguments"
- **Try:** "I'm preparing a public health education session. Can you help me understand the common concerns expressed by individuals hesitant about vaccines, and how healthcare providers might compassionately address each concern with scientific evidence? This will help me develop balanced educational materials."

### 4. Truncated or Incomplete Responses

**Symptoms:**
- Response cuts off mid-sentence
- "I'll continue if you'd like" messages
- Missing sections from what was requested
- Abbreviated analysis

**Solutions:**
- **Break complex requests into sequential prompts**
- **Specify upfront what components you need**
- **Ask for numbered sections** to ensure completeness
- **Request continuation** explicitly if needed
- **Set priorities** for what's most important if response length is limited

**Example Improvement:**
- **Structured approach:** "Let's tackle this in parts. First, please address [component 1]. After you've completed that, I'll ask about components 2 and 3."

### 5. Overly Technical or Simplified Responses

**Symptoms:**
- Response too advanced for intended audience
- Response too basic for your needs
- Missing nuance important to your field
- Inappropriate terminology

**Solutions:**
- **Specify the target audience** (undergraduates, fellow researchers, etc.)
- **Indicate desired complexity level** explicitly
- **Request definition of technical terms** if needed
- **Ask for analogies or examples** to clarify complex concepts
- **Provide feedback** on appropriate level and adjust

**Example Improvement:**
- **Clear guidance:** "I'm preparing materials for first-year medical students who have basic biology background but no clinical experience. Please explain [concept] at an appropriate level for this audience, defining any specialized terminology, and including relevant clinical examples."

### 6. Difficulty with Specialized Knowledge

**Symptoms:**
- Outdated information in rapidly evolving fields
- Lack of depth in niche areas
- Missing important developments or approaches
- Oversimplification of complex methodologies

**Solutions:**
- **Provide key references or frameworks** as context
- **Include recent developments** you're aware of
- **Ask the AI to reason from first principles**
- **Use the AI to structure knowledge** rather than provide it
- **Verify specialized content** against authoritative sources

**Example Improvement:**
- **Knowledge scaffolding:** "In the field of quantum computing, recent developments have included [specific advancement]. Working from this foundation, can you help me think through potential implications for [your specific interest]? I'll verify technical details independently, but would value assistance in organizing the conceptual framework."

### 7. Repetitive or Redundant Content

**Symptoms:**
- Circular reasoning
- Same points repeated in different words
- Excessive summarization or recapping
- Filler content with low information density

**Solutions:**
- **Request conciseness** explicitly
- **Ask for bullet points** rather than paragraphs
- **Specify word or section limits**
- **Request specific information density** ("detailed but concise")
- **Direct the AI to focus on novel insights**

**Example Improvement:**
- **Direct instruction:** "Please provide a concise analysis of [topic] in no more than 5 bullet points, focusing only on unique insights without repetition or filler content."

### 8. Privacy and Confidentiality Concerns

**Symptoms:**
- Uncertainty about what research information is appropriate to share
- Concerns about intellectual property protection
- Questions about data security

**Solutions:**
- **Avoid sharing identifiable participant data**
- **Abstract or generalize sensitive research details**
- **Focus on methodological questions** rather than specific findings before publication
- **Use hypothetical scenarios** based on your real situation
- **Break dependency on AI tools** for truly sensitive work

**Example Improvement:**
- **Privacy-conscious approach:** "I'm researching a condition similar to [comparable established condition] with the following general characteristics [generalized description]. What methodological approaches would be appropriate for studying this type of condition?"

### 9. Citation and Reference Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Non-existent paper citations
- Incorrect attribution of ideas
- Made-up DOIs or journal references
- Plausible but fictional sources

**Solutions:**
- **Verify all citations independently**
- **Ask for descriptive information** rather than specific citations
- **Request reasoning rather than references**
- **Provide your own sources** and ask for analysis
- **Use AI for structuring literature you've already verified**

**Example Improvement:**
- **Source-focused prompt:** "Based on general knowledge in the field rather than specific citations, what are the main theoretical approaches to [topic]? I'll locate specific references myself."

### 10. Inconsistent Formatting and Structure

**Symptoms:**
- Response doesn't follow requested format
- Inconsistent organization
- Missing sections you requested
- Structure that doesn't match academic conventions

**Solutions:**
- **Provide explicit formatting instructions** at the beginning of your prompt
- **Use numbered lists** for multi-part requests
- **Include examples** of the format you want
- **Request specific headers or sections**
- **Ask for revisions** if format doesn't match needs

**Example Improvement:**
- **Format specification:** "Please structure your response using APA-style headings and subheadings with the following main sections: Introduction, Methodology Considerations, Ethical Implications, and Practical Applications. Each section should be approximately 100-150 words."

## When to Seek Human Assistance

Despite their capabilities, AI assistants have limitations. Consider seeking human expertise when:

- Dealing with cutting-edge research not covered in the AI's training
- Needing field-specific methodological guidance for complex designs
- Requiring disciplinary context that may be nuanced or evolving
- Working with sensitive or confidential research data
- Navigating ethical considerations specific to your research area
- Seeking mentorship or career advice based on lived experience
- Needing critical evaluation of your research design or conclusions
