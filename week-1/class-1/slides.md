# Introduction to AI Assistants for Research
## Week 1, Class 1

---

## Today's Objectives

- Understand what AI assistants are and how they work
- Compare leading AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, Deepseek)
- Learn basic interaction techniques
- Practice writing effective prompts
- Develop awareness of limitations and best practices

---

## What Are Large Language Models (LLMs)?

- AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data
- Use pattern recognition to predict likely text continuations
- Notable examples: Claude (Anthropic), GPT-4 (OpenAI), Deepseek
- Capable of understanding context and generating human-like responses

---

## How Do They Work?

- Pattern recognition across billions of documents
- Not true "understanding" but statistical prediction
- No internet access (unless specifically enabled)
- Knowledge cutoff dates limit recent information
- Not designed to store your personal information between sessions

---

## Comparing Leading AI Assistants

### Claude AI (Anthropic)
- Strengths: Nuanced understanding, follows instructions precisely, long context window
- Limitations: Knowledge cutoff dates, occasional "hallucinations"
- Best for: Complex research questions, detailed analysis, content generation

---

## Comparing Leading AI Assistants

### ChatGPT (OpenAI)
- Strengths: Broad knowledge, coding abilities, web browsing capability
- Limitations: May occasionally give confident but incorrect answers
- Best for: Code generation, diverse tasks, accessing recent information

---

## Comparing Leading AI Assistants

### Deepseek
- Strengths: Strong technical and scientific capabilities
- Limitations: Less mainstream adoption, fewer integrations
- Best for: Technical tasks, scientific research, mathematics

---

## Basic Interaction Techniques

- Use clear, specific language
- Provide context for your questions
- Break complex requests into steps
- Use examples to illustrate what you want
- Iterate and refine based on responses

---

## What Can AI Assistants Help With?

- Summarizing research papers
- Explaining complex concepts
- Generating research questions
- Creating outlines and drafts
- Analyzing data and findings
- Brainstorming ideas
- Providing feedback on writing

---

## Limitations to Be Aware Of

- Cannot access or analyze your data unless you share it
- May produce "hallucinations" (confident but incorrect information)
- Limited knowledge of recent events (after knowledge cutoff)
- Not a replacement for domain expertise or critical thinking
- No guarantee of factual accuracy

---

## Ethical Considerations

- Academic integrity and proper attribution
- Privacy considerations when sharing research data
- Transparency about AI assistance
- Maintaining human judgment and oversight
- Potential biases in AI-generated content

---

## Basic Prompt Engineering

- The art of crafting effective instructions for AI assistants
- Critical for getting useful, accurate responses
- Skills that develop with practice
- Today's focus: Basic techniques for clear prompts

---

## Let's Practice!

- Open your preferred AI assistant
- We'll work through examples together
- Then you'll have time for independent practice
