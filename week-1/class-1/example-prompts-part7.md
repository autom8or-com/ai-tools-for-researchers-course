## 7. Research Method Selection

### Prompt:
```
I'm designing a study to understand how first-generation college students navigate academic challenges. I'm trying to decide between a purely qualitative approach (in-depth interviews) or a mixed-methods approach (surveys followed by interviews). What are the pros and cons of each approach for this specific research question? Which would you recommend and why?

# Comparing Research Approaches for First-Generation College Student Study

## Purely Qualitative Approach (In-Depth Interviews)

### Pros:
- **Rich contextual data**: Captures the nuanced lived experiences of first-generation students, including emotional, social, and cultural dimensions that may not emerge in surveys
- **Flexibility to explore**: Allows following unexpected but important themes that emerge during conversations
- **Honors student voices**: Centers the actual language and frameworks students use to describe their experiences
- **Trust building**: Allows developing rapport that may lead to more honest disclosures about challenges
- **Process understanding**: Better captures how students' strategies evolve over time and in response to different situations
- **Ideal for exploratory research**: Particularly valuable if this area lacks established frameworks specific to first-generation students

### Cons:
- **Limited sample size**: Typically restricted to 15-30 participants due to resource constraints
- **Generalizability concerns**: Findings may not represent the broader first-generation student population
- **Time intensive**: Conducting, transcribing, and analyzing interviews requires significant time
- **Researcher influence**: Interviewer characteristics and approach may affect responses
- **Less structured comparison**: Makes systematic comparison across different student characteristics more challenging
- **Perception issues**: May be viewed as less rigorous by some audiences or publication venues

## Mixed-Methods Approach (Surveys + Interviews)

### Pros:
- **Complementary strengths**: Combines breadth of surveys with depth of interviews
- **Triangulation**: Increases validity through multiple data sources
- **Representative patterns**: Surveys can establish prevalence of key challenges across a larger population
- **Targeted interviewing**: Can strategically select interview participants based on survey responses
- **Framework development**: Survey findings can inform more focused interview protocols
- **Quantifiable elements**: Provides measurable outcomes alongside explanatory narratives
- **Funding appeal**: Often viewed favorably by grant agencies seeking comprehensive approaches

### Cons:
- **Increased complexity**: Requires expertise in both methodologies
- **Resource intensive**: Demands more time and funding to implement properly
- **Integration challenges**: May be difficult to meaningfully connect quantitative and qualitative findings
- **Potential misalignment**: Survey constructs may not fully capture the experiences revealed in interviews
- **Diluted depth**: May sacrifice some depth in qualitative component due to resource splitting
- **Analysis complexity**: Requires sophisticated approach to integrate different types of data

## Recommendation for First-Generation Student Research

For understanding how first-generation students navigate academic challenges, I recommend the **mixed-methods approach** for these specific reasons:

1. **Established but evolving area**: Research on first-generation students exists, but navigation strategies may vary across institutions, backgrounds, and challenges. Mixed methods provides both broad patterns and contextualized understanding.

2. **Heterogeneous population**: First-generation students are diverse in terms of racial/ethnic background, socioeconomic status, age, and pre-college preparation. Surveys can help identify how strategies may differ across these characteristics, while interviews provide depth on why these differences exist.

3. **Practical applications**: If findings will inform institutional support programs, having both quantitative data on prevalence of challenges and qualitative insights on effective navigation strategies will be more persuasive to administrators and more useful for program design.

4. **Sequential design advantage**: Consider a sequential explanatory design where:
   - Initial surveys identify common challenges, resources accessed, and strategies employed
   - Survey results reveal patterns requiring explanation (e.g., why certain institutional resources are underutilized)
   - Interview protocols are then refined to explore these patterns
   - Purposive sampling selects interview participants representing diverse experiences identified in survey data

5. **Comprehensive literature integration**: The mixed approach allows engaging with both quantitative literature on student success factors and qualitative literature on student experience.

## Implementation Suggestions

If resource constraints are significant, consider:
- Using an existing validated survey instrument with minimal modifications
- Conducting a moderate number of interviews (12-15) focused on key survey findings
- Employing technology for transcription to reduce time demands
- Focusing interviews on specific strategies for overcoming the most common challenges identified in the survey
- Using joint displays to integrate findings (tables/matrices showing quantitative results alongside illustrative quotes)

This approach would provide both the statistical picture of challenges and strategies while still honoring the unique voices and experiences of first-generation students navigating the complex landscape of higher education.
