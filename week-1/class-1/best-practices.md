# AI Assistant Best Practices for Researchers

Use this checklist to ensure you're getting the most value from AI assistants while maintaining research integrity.

## ✓ Effective Prompt Construction

- [ ] **Be specific and clear** about what you need
- [ ] **Provide relevant context** about your field, audience, and purpose
- [ ] **Include constraints** such as word count, format, or complexity level
- [ ] **Break complex requests** into smaller, manageable parts
- [ ] **Use examples** to illustrate what you want
- [ ] **Specify your role** (researcher, teacher, student) for appropriate responses
- [ ] **Request specific formats** (bullets, paragraphs, tables) when needed

## ✓ Research Integrity

- [ ] **Always verify facts** provided by AI assistants with authoritative sources
- [ ] **Do not submit AI-generated text** as your own work without proper attribution
- [ ] **Be transparent** about AI assistance in research documentation
- [ ] **Use AI as a thought partner** rather than a source of factual information
- [ ] **Check citations** provided by AI (they are often fabricated)
- [ ] **Maintain critical thinking** and evaluate AI suggestions 
- [ ] **Follow institutional guidelines** on AI use in research

## ✓ Iterative Refinement

- [ ] **Start broad, then narrow** with follow-up prompts
- [ ] **Provide feedback** on what was helpful or unhelpful
- [ ] **Ask for revisions** rather than starting over
- [ ] **Save effective prompts** for reuse
- [ ] **Experiment with different phrasings** if you're not getting useful responses
- [ ] **Request alternative approaches** to the same problem
- [ ] **Clarify misunderstandings** immediately

## ✓ Productivity Enhancement

- [ ] **Use AI for first drafts**, not final products
- [ ] **Delegate routine tasks** like summarization or formatting
- [ ] **Request multiple options** to spark creativity
- [ ] **Use AI to explain complex concepts** from outside your field
- [ ] **Generate outlines** before detailed content
- [ ] **Ask for checklists** specific to your research tasks
- [ ] **Create templates** for recurring research documents

## ✓ Subject-Specific Considerations

- [ ] **Provide field-specific terminology** for more accurate responses
- [ ] **Mention methodological preferences** relevant to your discipline
- [ ] **Include information about target journals** when preparing manuscripts
- [ ] **Specify statistical approaches** when discussing research design
- [ ] **Reference theoretical frameworks** important to your analysis
- [ ] **Mention software or tools** you're using

## ✓ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- [ ] **Overreliance** on AI-generated content without verification
- [ ] **Vague prompts** that lead to generic responses
- [ ] **Accepting citations** without checking them
- [ ] **Sharing sensitive research data** or proprietary information
- [ ] **Using AI to generate data** or research results
- [ ] **Neglecting to mention constraints** or important context
- [ ] **Assuming field-specific expertise** from the AI

## ✓ Technical Tips

- [ ] **Start new conversations** for unrelated topics
- [ ] **Use file uploads** when discussing specific documents (where available)
- [ ] **Take advantage of different AI models** for different tasks
- [ ] **Save important conversations** for future reference
- [ ] **Export valuable insights** to your own notes
- [ ] **Clear context** when starting a new research topic
- [ ] **Use code blocks** for technical content
