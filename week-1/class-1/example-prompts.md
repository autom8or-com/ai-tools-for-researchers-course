# Example Prompts and Responses for Researchers

This document provides concrete examples of effective prompts for research-related tasks and actual AI responses. Use these as templates for your own interactions.

## 1. Literature Review Assistance

### Prompt:
```
I'm starting a literature review on the relationship between gut microbiome and depression. Can you suggest:
1. 5 key concepts I should understand
2. Potential search terms for academic databases
3. Types of studies I should look for (methodologies, sample sizes, etc.)
4. Common limitations in this research area
```

### Sample Response:
```
Here's some guidance for your literature review on gut microbiome and depression:

1. Key concepts to understand:
   - Gut-brain axis: The bidirectional communication network connecting the central nervous system with the enteric nervous system
   - Microbiota-gut-brain axis: How gut bacteria influence brain function and behavior
   - Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs): Bacterial metabolites that may influence mood regulation
   - HPA axis dysregulation: Stress response system affected by gut microbiome
   - Neuroinflammation: Inflammatory processes potentially linking gut dysbiosis and depression

2. Search terms for academic databases:
   - "gut microbiome" AND "depression"
   - "gut-brain axis" AND "mood disorder"
   - "microbiota" AND "major depressive disorder"
   - "intestinal bacteria" AND "mental health"
   - "probiotics" AND "depression treatment"
   - "dysbiosis" AND "depressive symptoms"
   - "fecal microbiota transplantation" AND "depression"

3. Types of studies to look for:
   - Randomized controlled trials of probiotic interventions (sample sizes >50)
   - Longitudinal observational studies tracking microbiome changes with mood
   - Case-control studies comparing depressed vs. non-depressed subjects
   - Animal models demonstrating mechanistic pathways
   - Meta-analyses and systematic reviews (particularly from the last 5 years)
   - Studies using 16S rRNA sequencing or metagenomics analysis

4. Common limitations in this research area:
   - Heterogeneity in depression diagnosis and assessment tools
   - Inconsistent methods of microbiome analysis
   - Confounding factors (diet, medication, lifestyle) often poorly controlled
   - Causality difficult to establish (correlation vs. causation challenge)
   - Small sample sizes in many studies
   - Limited standardization of probiotic interventions
   - Geographical and demographic limitations affecting generalizability
