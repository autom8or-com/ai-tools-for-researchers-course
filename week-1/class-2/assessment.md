**Submission Format:** Submit via the course learning management system as a single document (PDF or Word)

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Application of prompt engineering principles (40%)
- Critical analysis of prompt effectiveness (30%)
- Creative adaptation to research context (20%)
- Documentation quality and completeness (10%)

## Task 1: Prompt Engineering Case Study (40%)

### Instructions:
1. Identify a specific, challenging research task in your field that could benefit from AI assistance
2. Document your process of developing an effective prompt:
   - Initial prompt draft
   - Analysis of its weaknesses
   - Systematic improvements based on prompt engineering principles
   - Final optimized prompt

3. Execute both your initial and final prompts with an AI assistant
4. Compare and analyze the responses

### Deliverable:
Submit a case study (800-1000 words) that includes:
- Description of the research task and its challenges
- Your prompt development process with clear before/after examples
- Comparative analysis of AI responses to initial vs. optimized prompts
- Specific prompt engineering principles that made the biggest difference
- Screenshots or appendices with the complete prompts and responses

## Task 2: Research Prompt Template Library (30%)

### Instructions:
Create a personal library of 5 prompt templates customized for common research tasks in your discipline.

For each template:
1. Identify a specific research task (literature organization, methodology selection, etc.)
2. Create a reusable prompt template with clear placeholders
3. Include annotations explaining the function of each component
4. Provide one concrete example of the template in use
5. Test the template and document the results

### Deliverable:
A collection of 5 research-specific prompt templates, each containing:
- Template name and purpose
- The template text with clearly marked placeholders
- Brief annotations explaining key components
- One example of the template filled in for a specific use case
- Brief reflection on the template's effectiveness (100-150 words per template)

## Task 3: Prompt Chain for Complex Research Workflow (30%)

### Instructions:
1. Select a multi-stage research process from your field (e.g., literature review, study design, data analysis planning)
2. Break this process into 3-5 sequential steps
3. Create a "prompt chain" with specialized prompts for each step
4. Ensure each prompt builds on information from previous steps
5. Execute your prompt chain with an AI assistant
6. Document the process and results

### Deliverable:
Submit a complete prompt chain document that includes:
- Overview of the selected research process (150-200 words)
- Visual diagram showing the workflow of your prompt chain
- Each prompt in the chain, with explanation of its purpose
- Key outputs from each step and how they feed into subsequent steps
- Critical analysis of the chain's effectiveness (200-300 words)
- Suggestions for improving the chain based on your results

## Portfolio Integration

These assignments will form the "Prompt Engineering" section of your course portfolio. Save all materials (including your original prompts, complete AI responses, and reflections) as you will continue to refine these throughout the course.

---

## Submission Guidelines

Your submission should include:
1. A title page with your name, field of research, and date
2. All three tasks clearly labeled with appropriate headings
3. Complete documentation of prompts and key portions of responses
4. Your analysis and reflections in well-structured paragraphs
5. Appendices with full responses if needed for reference
