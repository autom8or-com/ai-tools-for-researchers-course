## Guided Practice: Prompt Transformation (30 minutes)

### Activity 1: Basic to Advanced Prompt Transformation

**Objective:** Practice transforming basic prompts into more effective ones using prompt engineering principles.

**Instructions:**
1. For each basic prompt below, identify its weaknesses
2. Transform it into an effective prompt using the principles covered in class
3. Test both the original and your improved version with an AI assistant
4. Compare the responses and note the differences

**Basic Prompt 1:** "Give me information about research methods."

**Potential Improvements:**
- Add specific context (your field, purpose)
- Specify what aspect of research methods you're interested in
- Indicate your current knowledge level
- Request a particular format or structure
- Include constraints (length, complexity)

**Basic Prompt 2:** "Help me with my literature review."

**Potential Improvements:**
- Specify the research topic
- Mention key papers or theories you're already familiar with
- Indicate what stage of the literature review you're at
- Request specific help (organization, gap identification, etc.)
- Provide constraints and output preferences

**Basic Prompt 3:** "What statistical analysis should I use?"

**Potential Improvements:**
- Describe your research question
- Specify variables and data types
- Mention sample size and sampling method
- Indicate assumptions you can verify
- Request explanation of recommendations

**Discussion:**
- Which transformations made the biggest difference in response quality?
- How did adding context change the AI's approach?
- What specific formatting requests were most effective?

### Activity 2: Template Development

**Objective:** Create reusable prompt templates for common research tasks.

**Instructions:**
1. Select one research task from the list below
2. Develop a detailed prompt template with placeholders
3. Test your template with a specific example
4. Refine based on the response
5. Share your template with a partner for feedback

**Research Tasks:**
- Analyzing strengths and weaknesses of a methodology
- Generating research questions from a broad topic
- Creating an explanation of a complex concept for different audiences
- Designing a research plan or timeline
- Brainstorming implications of research findings

**Example Template Structure:**
```
I am a [your role] working on [specific topic/project].

I need help with [specific task] for the purpose of [goal/audience].

Here is the relevant background information:
- [Key point 1]
- [Key point 2]
- [Key point 3]

Please provide a [format] that includes:
1. [Element 1]
2. [Element 2]
3. [Element 3]

Additional constraints:
- [Constraint 1 - e.g., length, style, perspective]
- [Constraint 2]
```

**Discussion:**
- What elements did you find most important to include?
- How detailed should placeholders be?
- How might you adapt this template for different specific needs?

## Independent Practice: Applied Prompt Engineering (30-45 minutes)

### Exercise 1: Research Question Refinement

**Objective:** Apply prompt engineering to refine research questions in your field.

**Instructions:**
1. Start with a broad research interest from your field
2. Craft a detailed prompt asking for help refining this into specific research questions
3. Include relevant context about:
   - Your field and specialization
   - Current state of knowledge
   - Methodological preferences
   - Available resources or constraints
   - Desired impact of your research
4. Request multiple options with rationales
5. Follow up with a refining prompt based on the initial response

**Reflection Questions:**
- How did the quality of suggested research questions compare with what you might develop independently?
- What aspects of your prompt were most effective in guiding the AI?
- What additional information would have improved the suggestions?

### Exercise 2: Comparative Methodology Analysis

**Objective:** Use AI to compare methodological approaches for your research.

**Instructions:**
1. Identify a research question you're interested in exploring
2. Create a prompt that:
   - Clearly states your research question
   - Specifies 2-3 methodological approaches you're considering
   - Provides context about your research constraints
   - Requests a comparative analysis with pros and cons
   - Asks for recommendations with reasoning
3. Test your prompt and evaluate the response
4. Refine and retry if necessary

**Reflection Questions:**
- Did the AI identify methodological considerations you hadn't considered?
- How balanced and nuanced was the comparison?
- What aspects of your prompt led to the most helpful parts of the response?

---

### Exercise 3: Explanation Generation

**Objective:** Create prompts that generate clear explanations of complex concepts.

**Instructions:**
1. Select a complex concept from your field that you often need to explain
2. Create a prompt requesting explanations for three different audiences:
   - Peers in your field
   - Students or newcomers to the field
   - Non-specialists or the general public
3. Include specific guidance about:
   - Technical language expectations for each audience
   - Appropriate analogies or examples
   - Visual explanations that could accompany the text
   - Common misconceptions to address
4. Test your prompt and evaluate the explanations

**Reflection Questions:**
- How well did the explanations adapt to each audience?
- Which elements of your prompt most effectively guided the adaptation?
- How would you modify these explanations for your actual use?

---

### Exercise 4: Literature Organization

**Objective:** Use prompt engineering to help organize literature in your field.

**Instructions:**
1. Identify a research topic you're exploring
2. List 5-10 key papers or findings in this area
3. Create a prompt that:
   - Provides context about your research focus
   - Includes the key papers/findings
   - Requests help organizing this literature (themes, conflicts, methodological approaches)
   - Asks for visualization suggestions (concept map, matrix, timeline)
   - Seeks identification of potential gaps
4. Test your prompt and evaluate the organizational framework provided

**Reflection Questions:**
- How does the AI-suggested organization compare with your current thinking?
- What new connections or perspectives emerged?
- How might you use this framework in your actual literature review?

## Advanced Challenge: Prompt Chaining (If Time Permits)

**Objective:** Develop a sequence of prompts to tackle a complex research task.

**Instructions:**
1. Select a complex research task (literature review, study design, analysis plan)
2. Break it down into 3-4 sequential steps
3. For each step, create a specialized prompt that:
   - Builds on information from the previous step
   - Focuses on a specific sub-task
   - Includes appropriate context and constraints
4. Execute your prompt chain and evaluate the overall result
5. Identify where the chain could be improved

**Example Chain for Study Design:**
- Prompt 1: Research question refinement
- Prompt 2: Methodological approach selection
- Prompt 3: Sampling strategy development
- Prompt 4: Measurement instrument design

**Reflection Questions:**
- How did breaking the task into a chain affect the quality of the final output?
- Where were the transitions between prompts most effective or problematic?
- How might you apply prompt chaining to other complex tasks in your research?
